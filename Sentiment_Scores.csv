"Uh, just a much needed win. Uh, we played a hell of a game against the Lakers, one of the best teams in the league right now, uh, we took that same energy and that same determination and brought it here tonight, uh we were down big earlier in the game and that first half, came back in the fourth quarter and just played our game and, just let things happen, and, came out with a great win. I mean for me I know uh, somebody was trying to be a hero, so whoever had the ball, I knew they weren't gonna make their pocket pass to Tristan Thompson, so I just stepped up and helped our guard out, got one block, and then uh, great contest on uh, Sexton at the end of the game. Man, you know, Sekou looks outstanding, he's playing great, playing great, putting a lot of confidence, he's playing smart, and he's learning each and every game too so, really really proud of him. I was - I was excited. I was definitely definitely excited. That was a hell of a dunk by him, definitely, early in his career to have one of those highlight plays too, so I'm sure it'll be something that he'll remember. Uh, definitely you know, he was one of our - one of our leaders on our team, you know, we're gonna miss him, not even just as a player, but as a person having him around, so whenever he gets back we're looking forward to seeing him and uh hopefully the surgery goes well and he comes back healthy. Thank you.",2
"I love it here in Detroit, so, I have no, I have no problems. I love it here so I can't control what happens when it comes to that aspect of, you know, the situation. No. Hell no. Nothing like that happens to me during the game. I just was having a rough start, came out of here at half time, had a better mindset, and just played well. I'm not a quitter. That's for one, uh, I was never brought up to be a quitter, so if I start somewhere I finish there, and try to complete the mission, which is winning a championship here so, it'll never be me that wants to go anywhere, so we can - we can write that down. So uh, I love being here - I would love to play here the rest of my career, um, just staying the course, that's really it. I mean I've been dealing with this since the year I signed my contract, so trade rumors will always come around, it's just another year for me. It's always that time of the year around January, where the trade talks come, uh, nothing's happened, I mean obviously the talks have started so, these questions will start to come so, I've been looking forward to them coming, but for me, I'm just gonna continue to play - play the game I play, play here in Detroit, where I love to be, and whatever happens happens. Uh, I mean it wasn't really much to talk about, just said, you know, it's that time of the year again, um, it's nothing that's eminent, it's not like they're about to move me tomorrow, I mean obviously they're listening. Uh, but I think I'm fine where I'm at He's playing great. He's playing with a lot of confidence, uh, I talk to him consistently on the court, so I'm tryna keep him going while he's in the game, cause he does get a little lost sometimes, but he's very good listener, hell of an athlete, and a great defender as well too, so uh, two double doubles in his - his two starts, so, looking forward continuing to play with him and, his growth has been great. Yes, great company to be in. No. I mean he's a tough kid, I mean, he's been playing professionally for a long time already so he's already had - he already has the toughness, it's more of him just learning the game, and just learning the players around this league, and learning how to defend them, so I think he's doing a great job and he's playing to the best of his - best of his ability, excuse me. Just the pace of the game, I mean obviously Derrick is really good at pushing the pace and, you know, getting guys going early, and you know he finds his shots uh, relatively easy too, when he comes of the pick and roll, so, he makes it easy for all of us when he plays that way.",1
"It's another night in the office man. I'm just trying to - trying to play the best basketball I could play, trying to put my team in a good position to win, and uh just have fun while I do it. Naw man, you know I can't control none of that stuff so I just come out here and play to the best of my ability, whatever happens happens, if it does I mean, ain't nothing I can do, I can't control it, so I'm just gonna play as hard as I can. I mean it's always fun when we come out and play like this man. We played a hell of a game, everybody played tough on both ends of the court, and uh - , you know we play like that every night, you know, anything can happen for us. Definitely. It's good to have him back, um I know he's trying to find his legs right now and uh, it'll come in time. He's a good basketball player man. Hell of a roller, hell of a defender, uh, he - he plays hard man, he plays really hard, he keeps playing like that, anything can happen for him. Uh, he looks like he's a great learner as well too, so I know the coaching staff over there's gonna take care of him, and uh, I love him as a big. No worries.",2
"Uh, I thought it was a joke. I thought it was a joke at first, but uh, you know, obviously when it all settles in I - truly excited to be somewhere where I'm wanted, uh I'm really happy to start a new chapter here, and uh, just looking forward to being with the guys. You know for me I'm just looking forward to playing the Cleveland Cavalier jersey, uh I'm excited to be here, you know, everything happens for a reason, so I look at the bright - as it a bright - as a bright note for me and my family to start somewhere new and uh, be with a great group of guys. I make myself very dominant in my position, so it makes it hard not to - not to wanna be around it, so for me I just uh, play as hard as I can, try to put my team in a good position to win, and uh, I think I can do that here. I mean we're here so that means we're appreciated by somebody so I - I wouldn't say we're underappreciated, I think we're here for a reason, and uh, they wanna see it for a reason as well too. Definitely with the guards, the young guards, I'm definitely looking forward to working with them, and uh, shedding some insight both on offense and defense as well too, getting uh, getting some film on them today too so I can sit down and really watch how they play, so I know what I'm working with but, I think I can really hep them out. Absolutely, just a - that's a back line defense you know uh, definitely communication's gonna be huge with them, I know they're young and they're still learning, but if I can help them get past that curve a little bit earlier, I think we'll be very good. For what? I mean, I think for me - I think for me, it'd be pretty - pretty easy, I'm very bright, so it won't take me very long to get adjusted to the system, uh I've played against the Cavs a handful of times, I know what they do, what they run, uh so it's just really getting acclimated to the team and I think anything - anything could happen. I think our - I'm excited to be here, very excited to be here, and I'm looking forward to playing with this young team and we have a great core here as well. Yeah, so Kevin and I have a great relationship, we're in the same agency as well too so, the relationship was already there even if I would've been playing against each other so, when the trade came through, you know, he was the first person to call me and uh, truly was ecstatic to have me here cause uh, we both were talking about, you know we didn't know what was gonna happen during the trade deadline, so to be here with him, uh knowing somebody that I've had a relationship for a long time is great. He's a great shooter, great passer, and I think I can help him very - a lot in both ends of the court as well too, help - you know, lessen the load on him. I mean I won't - I'm not taking anybody's job, I'm just here to play, I mean I didn't come here expecting anything, uh I'm just here to do my job, whatever they need me to do, you know I'll - I'll get it done, so if it's being a starter, coming off the bench, you know whatever they need for me to help this team be successful, I'll do it. Yeah, the game is changing, so obviously the shooting will come later in my career, but as of now, I'm very efficient with handling the ball and making plays, uh, in the open court with the dribble hand off and uh, the pick and roll game as well too, and able to spread out for the three point shot so, I think working on that part of my game is really been beneficial for me, and uh the next step is taking a wide open three. You know for me, just coming to an organization that wants me to be here. You know that's really all it boils down to is, my excitement is - is genuine, I'm really happy to be here, I mean obviously despite the record it doesn't phase me, I know I can do a lot of things here to help us improve and get ready for the next season. Correct. Yeah. Yeah, I - I spoke to Blake, you know immediately after I talked to Reggie, you know guys that have been traded before and, you know, they gave me different insights on what I should do, and how I should approach it, and it's - it's really worked, you know obviously I'm just excited to be here - today was a great day of practice, I've learned a lot, and I'm looking forward to playing tomorrow. That's for me to know. No - It doesn't - It doesn't phase me, um, cause I see a bright future here in Cleveland, you know, the young guys here are really really good, and uh, just with the addition of myself and having Kevin be healthy, I think we could do really really - we could do special things here. Man I just got here man, I haven't even unpacked the bag yet, I haven't thought - I haven't thought - I haven't thought about anything you know, as of right now I'm a Cleveland Cavalier and I'm just excited to be here. No - no. My main focus is getting here and getting adjusted as quick as possible. Yeah, I'm not - I can't think about that now, I mean I - I have to control what I control, I have thirty games here left, you know, play to the best of my ability, help us get in a good situation, and win as many games as possible, and whatever happens in the summer time, we'll take care of it then. Yeah, since I was sixteen I've known Koby [inaudible] fifteen years old I've known Kobe, so [inaudible] Absolutely, you know he called me - he called me as well too, and just uh, just that connection between USA basketball just - everything we've been through from sixteen to I'm twenty six now, and just having that relationship still and to play under his leadership now is awesome. Yeah. He was like - he was like the ball kid for - for - like for U - USA basketball and like look at him now, you know, he's a - he's a general manager for the Cleveland Cavaliers which is incredible for him. No. No, it was actually pretty scary landing, but obviously I'm safe and I'm here now, but it was definitely uh a rocky flight. Just play to the best of my ability, learn the system, uh, find ways to help get our guards better, uh find ways to just help this team, you know, get out of this rut, and you know, put us in a good situation to have a successful offseason and do something special next year. Just - I think I'm a bring the toughness, I think I'm gonna really on that apsect on both ends of the court, and uh, I think we'll be fine. I think uh, I know a lot of things that I can share with them and I know they know a lot of things to share with me as well too, so it'll be a - be a good dialogue. Oh, we already know - we already know that's gonna go down [inaudible]. No, the numbers don't lie, so they ain't gonna be fighting in - they gonna be very much fighting.",1
"It was fun, I was excited uh, we're gonna be - I think we're gonna be a really good team, uh we just have to work out some kinks, obviously it's my first game here, we had no practice time, uh so it's expected for us to look, you know, lost, obviously, cause we're trying to figure out plays, I didn't really know many plays yet, uh defensively we're still trying to figure eachother out on, you know, where we need to be but, I think with this break coming up, I think it's gonna be good for us to be able to get some practice time in and really learn eachother. Not at all. I think it's patince. I think uh, patience is key for our guards, I know they, you know they get - they get ahead of themself sometimes too and they get scored on and they try to come back and try to do it - do it right back to the same person, but I think if we slow the game down and, you know, take our time and figure out what we need to do on both ends of the court we'll be fine. Uh, defensively I think we'll be okay, I think this is for me to learn where I need to be on the court to, you know, help our guards get back in front, offensively it's just taking our time. I've been working on it for eight straight years. This the first team to let me use it, so - so uh Yeah, so, it's uh, you know something I'll be using more, more and more, uh I had the green light to shoot it, obviously, within rhythm, not just taking it off the bounce and shooting if I'm open, you know, take the shot, so. It's something I've worked on, so I feel comfortable taking it. You know, my mind was at ease actually. You know, you you would think I'd - I didn't have any jitters, you know, I - I think the home fan - like the fan base here did a really good job of welcoming me as well to making me feel comfortable while I was here, just, being in the street, you know, going to restaurants and just seeing people, and just how excite - how excited they are to have me here and just, you know my positive energy just being in the locker room, just trying to help our team get to a good situation. It was weird cause uh, he didn't recruit me in college so I made fun of him all the time for that. So uh, definitely definitely have a good relationship with coach Beilein uh, watched him while he was at school, he's a hell of a coach, uh he's doing a great job here obviously, you know, it's his first couple of months here so, it's gonna take some time for him to get adjusted, he still needs to learn - learn the game, it's a big transition from the college to the NBA, so I think once he learns the game and learns what it takes to - to win, I think we'll be great. Absolutely. I mean obviously we're - we're not looking at the scoreboard, I - I said it when I first got here in the locker room, I said, you know, I don't - and I said it to the media as well, I don't care about the record, I don't care about the scoreboard, I just care about did we get better today? Uh, obviously we're not gonna win every game the rest of the way out, but our goal is to try to win some games. We're not gonna sit on and allow teams to just blow us out, we're gonna play to the best of our ability each and every night, um, my goal is to push these guys and keep them positive and, you know, just continue to work hard and show no fight - I mean show no quit I mean, excuse me. Yeah I think the team, they really just asked me to speak up, I mean - I mean, whatever I see, you know, they tell me to say it, you know I don't really intend to step on anybody's toes or try to come and take anybody's shine or anything like that but, if somebody asks a question I do do a really good job of just, responding back and giving them my insight on what I think, uh, been on a winning team and I haven't won a championship - Kevin Love and Tristan have, but, you know, I know what it's like to win, so guys that are come in, like, you know, KP and, you know, Garland and Sexton, you know when they ask me questions, I take the time to really sit down and talk to them. I spent a lot of time today with them at the shoot around as well too. Just the grit, I mean, they're - they're tough guards and they're - they're smart, I think it's just giving them some time to learn the game and then once - once they do it, it's gonna be very scary, cause they're very athletic, they're smart, they're crafty, so, when it's used the right way, it can be very dangerous. You know for me I'm a Cleveland Cavalier now, so I can't really control what happened then, uh, happy to be here, uh, excited that I got to play my first game in a Cavalier jersey and I'm looking forward to playing again on Wednesday. It was - it was fun, it was fun, you know, playing with Kevin was great, just having a guy that can shoot the ball very well, uh consistently off the dribble hand off, when I pitched it back to him he was knocking them down, so that's gonna be a threat to use throughout the rest of the way. I mean, I think I've watched a total of eight hours of film on this entire team in the past two days, so I think I know quite a bit about this team right now, so I've taken the time to really learn these guys, you know, I watched a hundred clips on KP, Garland, and Sexton, on - on their drives, how they handle pick and rolls, so, I know everything I need to know about them, you know, with the bigs I've watched everything on them too, so this is like a time for me to really take, you know, I'm - I'm taking the time to really learn these guys, [inaudible] come here, you know hanging my head, I'm here with a positive attitude and trying to instill that in everybody else. Yeah, it's new, it's new so, you know, we have some time to practice the next couple of days, we have two days of practice before our next game, and, we'll figure it out from there. For - Yeah, for them, I just tell them to keep coming on the pick and rolls, like you know, when we set a pick and roll, just like - I tell them not to just die on the screens, just keep coming, and you know, corral them and I'll do my best to keep them in front and give them enough time to get back in front of the guard. For what? Um, again, you know, I'm playing for Cleveland, I can't, you know, really answer that question. You know, if I'm here in Cleveland, I'm playing to the best of my ability, I'm having fun while I'm out there with the guys, I'm really happy to be here, and uh, you know that's really all it boils down to. Yeah, so you know, again, you know, the film session I've - I watched in my hotel room, I watched - I was watching film all day today in the hotel and uh, you know I pulled all thre of those guards together, KP, Sexton, and Garland, and I told them what I saw when I watched film and I just gave them different pointers throughout the game - if you - if you watch closely, they got a lot - a lot more open today too, cause I was telling them how to come off of pick and roll to get their shot.",2
"I feel good. I'm starting to learn the guys a lot more, um, we're having more fun. You know just where guys like to be on the floor, they're giving me the ball a lot to make decisions, so I'm trying to see where guys like to cut, where they like it in their shooting pockets and uh, on the break where they want to catch the ball. That's a little ways from now, right now I'm worried about being a Cavalier and trying to get our team to be the best that we can be, and uh, just have fun while I do it. Yeah, I've been - I've been a part of USA basketball for a really long time, so uh, just to have my name be called again is - is pretty cool. You know I'm just gonna go with the flow, and uh, just whatever happens happens to me. I'm not looking to force anything, I'm just trying to get acclimated and be as comfortable as I can with my teammates. Yeah, I mean the spirits were really high today in practice, uh everybody came in with good energy so I think uh, last - you know last night was a game we couldn't control, it was our first game together, a lot of excitement, lot of jitters going along with - you know with me being here, so I think tomorrow's game will be a lot better for us. Yeah, I mean that's something I do all - I do all the time, just watch film a lot, the guys I play with, other team obviously but, you know I got a chance to sit down with some of the guards today, tell them some stuff that I saw again from the game and it worked today in practice with the stuff that we worked on. You know I said - I said it uh last night after the game, I said you know I'm not here to just play, I'm here to get better, I'm here to make you guys better, I'm here to try to win some games, I mean we're not gonna sit here and be complacent with being thirteen and fourty. I'm trying to string together some wins and give the city some hope. Yeah, last year - last year, we did that uh with - with Detroit, you know we were - we were down right before All Star break, came back and made it to the eigth seed.",2
"Disappointed, you know like you said we had four days off you know there are the back-to-back but you would think is the other way around. You know if you watch, you know, the game you know they play harder than us. They got more you know lose balls you know. They wanted it more you know. That's the end result of it. For sure it's not easy to win you know in this league so every loss we take, you know especially consecutively, you know we're losing eight in a row you know so you know can get worse so we can get better you know it's gonna be on us to change it around. Yeah, we been going hard in practice, you know practice has been good, you know. [inaudible] translates into this game. Kind of both because we know how bad we needed this game. You know we're just digging ourselves you know a deeper hole, you know, and we knew coming in this game that they needed it also you know so it's gonna be a battle, it's gonna be a fight. It's not hard to keep faith, you know just the adversity, you know that's it. We know we can win this way because we did. You know we beat some good teams so just got to stay with it. You just got taken it ourselves like you know we know we are on a back to back we have four days off you know there's no excuse to let them you know outwork us. There's little things like that.",0
"They got a lot of guards that can you know, take it to the basket and create. You know, Steven Adams, the big boy in paint you know. So all the rebounds, tip-in's, you know, he creates extra possessions for them. To be honest, I don't even know. Not to sure, you know I guess I couldn't figure it out. Oh, for sure you know he made it interesting game. You know he came in, gave us great minutes, knocked down some big shots making big plays for us. He's tough, you know, he's very tough. You know he's a you know big guard that can join the floor, create for others and you know, he's a bucket. You know, he can get a bucket when he needs to. Yeah you know every time I drive I see, you know, a lot of defenders and you know the lane and getting to the lane is pretty much clogged up. Naw they've been physical from the beginning of the year. You know, that's not the problem. You know, I just need to adjust to you know how, defenses are playing me.",1
"I felt good, you know, I felt great early. I feel like everyone you know the pace, you know we're playing at or creating it for each other and I feel like in the first half we knock down a lot of shots For sure, for sure. You know it's always been a goal of mine so you know get it done. Hopefully there's more to come now. I feel like they adjusted you know they adjusted well and they came off a bang. You know and I feel like that little stretch in the fourth and you know kinda setting the lead and it was hard to come back from that. I can't really tell. You know like every team that plays us, every team is you know physical you know so I can't really tell. As long as everyone is in a good rhythm you know I'm good you know I feel like everyone should get a chance to touch the ball but that's what's gonna hit shots and be in their rhythm you know but I do feel good, you know with the ball in my hand, you know I feel like I worked hard to you know make the right decision and if I don't then there make the right decision next time. You know so it feels good Never really got chance you know talk to, too much of the guys, but you know I've got great respect for Coach Nurse and I plan I having a conversation with him, you know eventually, yeah. I'm not sure you know we're in a race right now, you know my team is struggling a little bit so we just got to get back, and you know try and get in a playoff run, you know. That is my main, my main you know goal right now and after that and I'm a you know really decide on the Canada basketball stuff. Yeah, I follow them, I follow them. You know a lot of talent, a lot of talent. RJ is doing his thing this year Shai he's out having an amazing year you know he came in here had a career night. Lot a lot of young guys you know are coming in and doing thing. For sure, for sure. You know, the futures bright for all of them. Yeah, it's nice you know I'm close to home. Having KAT back is amazing, you know it makes the game easier for everyone playing you know and I feel like, you know, I feel like he was still in rhythm, you know I feel like tonight was kind of a tough night for everybody, and he played good in Indiana game but tonight was tough for everybody. You know so hopefully we'll get it back next game. It's a lot, you know, I worked hard a lot this summer, really hard you know. Shooting, ball handling, play making, finishing you know everything, you know and I'm gonna keep working. You know, keep, keep getting better. I have a lot of room to grow so I'm gonna keep at it. He's been playing great. You know he, Jarrett Culver is in a great great rhythm right now and I know it's gonna keep it up. You know his confidence is through the roof and when you're a rookie that's good. You know he's out there scoring, defending, making plays on both sides of the floor and you know so that's what we need from him.",3
"Well, getting off the plane when I got off I got a chance to come to the facility you know and check everything out and just leading up to the game I was just anxious and excited you know I know the crowd here is crazy the the energy here is you know amazing you know the culture is amazing so I'm just excited to be part of it For sure you know I met with them earlier and he was just like ""compete and just run the floor,"" you know that those are the main things you know and just hearing those words is making easier on me you know I'll have to come here and try and do a lot or nothing like that so I just felt there in the court at the game come to me the whole team we're all not selfish and I moved the ball and competed you know that's the most important thing Great team, a great team. I'm joining a championship team championship culture you know so I'm happy to be a part of it. I'm just playing with those guys I know the whole floor be you know open you know be not my best thing is attacking the basket you know and it's gonna be kind of hard to help if you have you know have Steph and Klay but just the way they're unselfish you know their their leadership, even Draymond, their leadership. I'm looking forward to it. I learned a lot in Minnesota you know not really no particular or specific, you know, thing I can think of right now but I've learned a lot you know over my you know five and a half years you know, just competing how to be a professional; certain things like that. I feel like you know everyone is entitled to their own opinion you know. It is what it is. I feel like when you're losing you know there's gonna be a little dark shadow over you but I'm here now you know this is a winning culture you know a winning team so hopefully people couldn't you know take a different view and you know it's watch us ball. Everything really you know just the way you know their approach, their practice facility, the arena everything amazing we know the culture around the locker room, you know the positivity the energy all of it. Like you said I lived my whole life from the cold you know so I'm very excited you know my girlfriend's excited my daughter she doesn't know yet but she's gonna be excited so it'll be a good time Yeah you know I was just like you know if it happens it happens. It's gonna be a blessing. You know either way and the news broke you know excited you know excited for both sides yeah that's basically it. Yeah, well I'm not really, I'm not really worried too much you know about you know the outside world and people talking. You know my job is just to go on the court you know hoop, play basketball you know so when everyone's talking rumors about me getting traded or anything I just play basketball and if happens it happens. You know it's happened that's God's plan. And you know, just leading up to it, I just well I woke up and then my coach, coach Ryan [inaudible] they call me and let me know. It's important you know I've been part of a, you know we lost a lot you know in Minnesota so coming here being part of a winning team winning culture it's different. You know losing is never fun you know and this being here and you can tell by everyone's attitude everyone's approach you know everything is, is everywhere you know that you know they're winners you know and that's something I want to be I wanted to be my whole career and I'm here so I'm happy. yeah you know this whole thing didn't really feel real totally you know that's my name and they're just like whoa you know I'm here you know just seeing the crowd and you know just seeing that weren't excited for me and you know just embracing them on their own I know it's a great feeling. Yeah. You know I believe in myself and you know that at the end of the day it's basketball you know you prepare for this moment your preparation is gonna prepare you for you know at any moment on the court. You know I feel like I was mentally ready and prepared to you know go out there and you know play good basketball.",2
"You know I am very excited. I feel like everybody is. He's that player that. Like [inaudible] come in and change how everyone plays for the better so I'm excited. Game changer. I think I can guard multiple decisions. You know, especially on the point guard when he's like [inaudible] disrupt the offense a little bit, you know. They've been giving me a lot of responsibility and I'm just taking it head on, you know. Accepting the challenge and being the best defender I can be for the team. There's a lot we could do. In that first quarter you know we come out ready, you know they did. I feel like they got a lot of their threes that way, you know and we kind of let them and they got hot. So including myself, come out with a mindset of you know, that's the game plan. Oh, it will make a big difference, you know especially for people that can drive and [inaudible] the basket. Steph attracts a lot of attention you know. He's someone you have to watch and look at every time he's on the floor. You know, you can't sleep, you can't relax on him at all or else he's going to open up the floor for everyone else. You know it is what it is. I've been in this position before. You know I was on Minnesota, there's a lot of times where we'd have, you know not a lot of players. So, it's not terrible. We're all young, you know, so you know we're not getting tired yet easily we're just playing for everything. You know there's going to be ups and downs in the season, but we're just fighting through, try to finish strong. For sure, for sure. Basically this team is just fast. Up and down, up and down. Pushing the ball ahead. So it's a little different. He's been doing great. You know on both sides of the floor defensively he's getting after it. You know he's showing them he can defend in multiple positions. You know he's fast, he's stronger than he looks. On offense he's shooting the ball well. He's playing with confidence, he's attacking. He's doing everything we need him to do. He's been great. I wouldn't say it's too much effort because we're all playing hard, you know. We came out playing hard and I feel like we didn't come out and follow the game plan you know correctly and you know there's a lot of stuff we could have done better.",3
"A lot of energy, you know. You can just sense it you know soon as we got out there I mean I can't remember who said but even in the huddle someone said it felt like the first game of the season he just got the energy was so crazy. Throughout the whole game really. He makes everyone you know great he makes that one you know play better he finds open man he's like the most unselfish superstar you know that's a good way to put it. You know he attracts so much attention that he's gonna find the open man and he makes the right play so it was fun. For everybody you know it makes the game fun he makes it exciting you know and it was it was a close game to the end you know so it was fun. Yeah for sure he's someone you want you know on your team. You know even though I was on Minnesota guarding him very hard to guard you know you never know what he's gonna do next, where he's gonna shoot it from you don't know what to expect, you know. So being on the other side of the floor with them you know just realizing his approach to the game, how he plays and how he creates space it's literally everything you know I'm just watching and learning you know mainly his approach you know and he's just professional on and off the court. I didn't even know what's coming really you know the kind of watching, watching I knew it may come but then when you went behind the back I was I was trying to catch it no I'm finished a play for him because it was a hell of a pass. I think in the game but you know also think in the future you know and I feel like next year will be a big year you know playing with Steph, Dremond, you know Klay. [inaudible] the floors in your wide open. You know those those are great players you know attract a lot of attention, you know really you know do the [inaudible] on the floor so I'm excited to get a chance to you know play you know play with them and you know feed off them and you know, win. Yeah you know become more of a consistent shooter. You know I feel like playing with those guys they create you know that I said they attract a lot of attention. Even today I had a bunch of wide-open threes, you know I didn't make you know too much of them but I had a bunch of wide open threes. So just being able to you know consistently shoot that open three.",2
"I think it's really important for us um, you know, it's a step closer to what we're trying to achieve and that's, you know, getting consistent wins and playing the right way, so I'm happy with the way we played tonight, just have to keep it up. Um, I think um, the fact that we were able to execute our game plan. Coach told us how they were going to defend us and, we moved the ball around it - very good today, you could tell, um, and we made shots man um, we finally were able to make shots but, like I said, we have to continue to play the right way and um, you know, I think that equals Ws. I understand that's my - one of my roles on this team is to come out with a defensive mentality and I try to do that every single night and um, I - I think that sets the -  not only sets the tone for the game, but it gets my teammates excited about playing defense and um, I'm gonna do that every single night, we have a game tomorrow and I -  I'mma bring it. Thank You.",3
"I feel good um, you know obviously it's disappointing that um, you know, we weren't able to come out with a win but um, all we can do is move on to the next game, we gotta practice tomorrow, have a chance to get better and prepare. Yeah. Yeah I - and they did a great job getting into the paint and - and making plays for one another um, you know whenever we are - we're playing that way, we're at our best and we - we didn't do a great job containing those guys - containing their guards good enough to keep them out the paint and um, you know, stopped them from making plays for other guys um, shooting the three. I think they did, um, you know, Dragic obviously saw that it was working. They ran the same play over and over and over again and he was just picking us apart. I feel like as a team we got to do a better job in - um, of trying to contain and bar pressure and finding the perfect medium between bar pressure and then playing smart defense um, and containing, you know, the guys that were guarding and um, it would have been a different outcome if we were able to do that consistently. Yeah it is a rhythm thing, you know I'm a little disappointed I didn't play the way I wanted to but, you know, it's - it's part of the game um, you know, there's - there's other ways that I can affect the game um, and I understand that and I feel like I - I just had to go out there and um, have the mindset that the shots eventually are going to fall um, I have to continue to play hard and um, have a defensive mindset for our team. I think they've taken full advantage of that opportunity, um those guys are playing well for us right now on both ends of the floor and they're gonna continue to keep - keep getting better and I said it yesterday um, it shows what kind of professionals um, they are and especially Reggie Bullock for him um, to go from not playing to starting and - and bring that spark and that energy to our team um, it means a lot to us um, you know as his teammates in I'm - I'm very happy for him and he's a good guy, good player, so he's playing well. Yeah um, you know it's tough. I - I think he's a little underrated on a defensive end uh, what Andre's able to bring for us on the defensive end is um - I think he's one of the best big - he is the best big man in pick and roll defense in the NBA and uh, missing him tonight you know, it was - it was tough, but we still had a chance to, you know, help each other um, and talk on the defensive end cause that's what it all - all it is about and effort, but we definitely did miss him on both ends of the floor tonight, defensively and offensively. Nah, I wouldn't say that um, I - I feel like every guy - we're a team um, and we understand that, you know, whenever somebody is out um, you know, where we miss those guys and we know that each and every person on this team brings something to the - to this team and so um, you know it's the next guy up and um, you know, it - it's just tough that we weren't able to get the win tonight.",1
"It's tough um, you know, I felt like we made a few mistakes late and um, you know they made some plays down the stretch and just unfortunate. We had chances to go up and get the lead but, you know, plays like that happen, we just - little plays throughout the game, I feel like we have to, you know, do better, um, as far as defending the basketball um, you know we had a lot of breakdowns and they - they picked us apart. They just played well tonight. I think um, you know they were able to get into the pick and roll um, get into the middle of the defense and kind of just picked us apart um, going into the game we knew that they were going to be a three point shooting team, the Mirotic um, the rookie um, we knew those guys were very good shooters and it's gonna be our job to you know make multiple plays to be able to defend the pick and roll and recover out um, and close out on those guys and we just didn't do it consistent enough. Um, we were able to get the steal and um, I feel like we gave ourselves a chance to make a layup and it was just unfortunate it didn't go in. I'm feeling better um, I think it has a lot to do with Ish, Dwight, Tobias, those guys were able to make plays for me um, get me going early and um, you know credit to them, I was able to get some easy shots at the beginning of the game and I feel like it helped me get a rhythm. I think we do and not only that um, you know Tobias has to continue to keep playing and make plays for our team um, he's a playmaker so when he's not scoring the ball he's able to make plays for other guys and um, you know tonight I feel like he did it um, he just has to continue to stay positive, he's a very good scorer, um, he'll play better next game for us, but we definitely need Tobias to play well in order for us to, you know, have a - a good offensive performance. I think they were um, and we may - yeah, we just have some bad tone - turnovers, especially myself, I think I had like three or four turnovers um, I just feel like it's unacceptable um, you know, we want to be able to be in every game or give ourselves chance to win games, we have to, you know, take care of the basketball. Yeah um, I feel like the team that, you know, comes out with um, you know energy sets the tone, and we didn't come out with a defensive mentality and we kinda, you know, we picked it up eventually but we have to come out with that intensity at the beginning of the game, because it's contagious and it helps our team a lot.",0
"Um, I was a little shocked but at the same time I was excited um, you know I - I knew I was gonna get the opportunity to, not only play for a great organization, but having a chance to - to play for Doc again. I - I thought it would be a great opportunity for me so um, I'm excited about this chance and uh, I'm excited to get out there on the floor. Yeah, I played with Doc for three years um, I feel like we were able to learn a lot um, you know we - we've been through a lot of battles together so um, you know to have a chance to play for him again I think is really gonna help and improve my game even - even more. It's funny um, I met Doc when I was eighteen, nineteen years old, and now I'm a twenty seven year old man so um, it's nice to have opportunity to uh, learn more from him um, I feel like we're - we're both at different points now um, he's probably learned so much um, from the last time I - I played for him so I feel like I -  we would be able to help each other out a lot. Yeah, we haven't had a conversation yet um, you know I'm open to bring whatever I need to bring to this team, um obviously the thing um, one thing that is one of my strengths is my defense and um, I know I'm gonna bring that instantly um, to this team but we haven't got a chance to sit down and talk yet so, but I'm open to whatever - whatever he needs me to bring to the team um, I - I'mma bring it, and bring it every single game a hundred percent. Yeah, I mean I'm pretty sure a lot of people were um, you know it's part of the business um, it's one of the biggest trades right now in the NBA so um, all I can do is say it's just part of the business and I wish the best for him. I - one thing I can say is playing against Blake, I know he's a very good player, a great professional and um, that you have a good - great player and he's going to a good organization so, it'd be a good fit. A lot colder. It's a good feeling, it's almost like coming um - moving into a new state with your family um, I couldn't ask to be part of a package with, you know, any better players and those guys and not only good players, they're great people, and so um, having them here definitely is gonna make this transition that much easier for me. No, I didn't play with anybody else or um, no, I mean everybody I think on this team uh - there's a lot of new - new faces um, not a lot of new guys but it seems like everybody's not only um, good people but hard workers um, so I'm - I'm looking forward to this opportunity. Health is good um, you know I've been battling a groin injury the past month or so but I feel like I'm in a good place now and um, ready to get out - out on the floor. I think yeah - Yeah, I think I fit in well. Um, you know, my entire career I've been a grind - grind uh, type of player. Um, I've been a guy that goes out there, hard nosed guy that plays hard and um, you know every single game I feel like um, you know, I just play with that mentality, so I should fit in perfectly.",2
"I felt like it was good um, you know, I need to still get my legs under me but um, I felt like it was a good start for us, we're - we're still getting used to each other but um, I feel like once we're able to learn how to play off one another um, you know, the sky's the limit for this team. It's been a while, I've been playing games but, I still - yeah - I still been in and out um, got some shots a few weeks ago so um, I'm just trying to get my legs back. We don't know much, we're just out there just playing basketball, that's what Doc told us to go out there and do today, try to play off one - um, each other and - and make plays for - for each other and so that's what we try to do. I think it is um, I think that's what kinda team we need to be and uh, the type of team that we can be. Can be any guys' night on any - any given night and um, I think it needs to be balanced like that, we need to move the ball and - and make plays for each other, because whenever we're able to play that way, we're playing free and I think it's gonna be hard for teams to be able to guard us. Yeah, I mean um, it's part of the business, I don't worry about it um, you know I went from Boston to Detroit and now I'm here, and this is my focus here and you know I - I try to control what I can control and all I can control is going out there and playing hard and - and trying to get wins for the Clippers. Um, I really take pride on defensive end, I felt like that's - that's the first - that's my first - my first gift like in this league uh, I know that's my first role on this team, that's been my first role on every team um, I need to bring that defensive intensity um, I feel like they - not only impacts the game for our team but it - it gets me going offensively um, it - it engages me and in the game and um, every single game I'mma come with that mindset because I think it can really help our team out. Yeah I mean Tobias was out there just playing basketball. He was able to make shots and I think he was confident um, you know Doc put him in some good positions um, to go out there and - and do what Tobias does and he played a terrific game tonight.",1
"I think it's a mix of me trying to find my rhythm in my game and trying to learn how to play off these guys, we have a lot of, you know, offensive um, minded guys on this team so uh, about to figure out and I - I think not only myself, but Doc has to figure out how he wants to use me so, uh, it's only been three games so, we'll figure it out. Yeah it definitely is challenging, because um, you know I've been a, in my eyes, I've been a two way player for the last four years in this league, so it's challenging, but it's part of the business, I gotta make the most of it, figure out other ways um, I know I wanted to challenge myself to get more rebounds, coming here I didn't get much in Detroit so, you just have to find other ways to be effective in the game. It made it pretty easy, I mean I understand Doc, I know - I know majority of the coaches here so, it made it - the transition a lot easier for me and um, even some of the offensive calls, it was easy. Um, I just came out here and um, you know, wanted to make a immediate impact and um, try to help our team win games right away.",1
"Uh, you know another game. Uh, we're we're fighting, fighting back we, we dropped so many early that we're fighting back but I mean this game has gone exactly how are all these other games. How we've, we've figured out a way to do it. If it's chippie, it's chippie. We fought, we've had each other's backs. I think that showed tonight. We were where we were supposed to be. We're in our locker room so, um, whatever happens over there I mean we can't control what anybody else does. We control that we did. We were in a locker room, everybody's in our seats you should ask them. Uh, you never know coming into games. Um, you know, Doc always talks about being you know in attack mode, being the aggressor, being the first one to attack him and you know I thought we did that for most of the game tonight. You didn't see? I saw it on the scoreboard. So ask me what I said. After what he said what he said, I said the same thing back. He, uh, asked me if I was still coming to his birthday party and I said ""Yeah, I'm gonna try,"" so, we'll see. Uh, yeah we have a different relationship. Is that it? I don't care about plus-minus. No. Um, you know we just got to do what we've done in the past, however many games we've been playing with the right spirit. Each game is an individual game and we have to look at it like that. I mean, it's, it is tough I mean we've been playing really well but you know I think we as a team know just as well as anybody that um a season can turn in in a blink of an eye so you have to give everybody the same attention. Um, you can't, you know say oh we won this game so the next game might be a little easier, it won't be. Our trust is really high offensively, defensively. The ball moves around, everybody touches the ball. Lou's been unbelievable obviously. It's been huge for us, but everybody just trusts and gets a chance, um, to shine and I think guys enjoy playing like this is some of the most fun I've had playing basketball in a long time. So, that's a tribute to, to this team, you know and the type of, uh, the type of I guess just attitude we've taken on. Our coaching staff is [inaudible] unbelievable job with so many injuries. It has just been that, not true, like ""next man up"" mentality. Uh, I just somebody grabbed me um they called a foul. I just wanted to like take the pad off cuz it was like keeping my shorts up so my whole leg was exposed. Uh, I don't know, I don't know anybody's intentions you know you'd probably have to ask somebody else. Um, I don't know other people's intentions, I just thought we played hard and got to win. No, I said uh earlier this morning an interview I thought you know they should they should welcome him back with with a warm reception and he gave, gave a lot to this team for six years. Um, you know when we had a lot of great moments we had some bad moments we had a lot of great moments. Ultimately, didn't have success in terms of the ultimate success but we I think built the built a foundation for this franchise and um you know I think that the fanbase here appreciates him for that.",1
"Um, I mean, you know if it's seventy from two yards or, um, seventy from four, you know it's seventy points. So, um, two guys are doing all the shooting you know some, some, some games you have to, you have to take that so, uh, I don't think we look at that as like a, um, you know, a crazy, crazy stat. You know, we obviously want to slow Wiggins down a little bit better, but you know. Um, I thought they did a good job of attacking Wiggins. Hit shots to get to the free-throw line, that the whole team got to the free throw line a lot. Uh, I thought that we got good looks. There was a couple, a couple, couple of calls that didn't go our way. I mean at the end of the day it wasn't, wasn't, um, the calls it was new Minnesota played it played a great game and they they won this game fair and square, but you know, lose three in the corner they called off? You know, plays like that, uh, those hurt.",0
"Yeah, they, uh, executed I think on probably every point they wanted to tonight. Uh, we just did a poor job of slowing him down. Um, but you got to give them credit for the way they play but we have to be better. Uh, they trust, they play team defense, you know. It's not a one-on-one defense by any means so, um, you just do a good job of playing hard and being there and being on rotations and all that. I mean, you know makes it tougher I think when you know two guys just in general are struggling shooting the ball. You know, as opposed to everybody shooting the ball well. Um, but you know we just have to trust our offense I need to do a better job of just keeping keep it moving and, um, making sure we get everybody else involved. Yeah, I mean there's. Yeah, for the most part, a bad night. I think there's like a couple of stretches where we put together a couple of stops, but ultimately, no, no you can't win a basketball game playing two minutes stretches well. Um, probably a little bit of both. I mean they do a good job defending like I said but we got some good shots. Um, wide open shots. We just missed them missed them. Um, you just have to [inaudible] team has been doing. We've been doing a good job of attacking, um, you know just being there for him and in outlet and attacking often, so you know, to get out of the trap.",1
"The shock pretty much worn off, but I'm, it's just followed by excitement you know to get going here and I've got a chance to be around the team this morning and, and you know it's even more exciting after you get that opportunity so, really hit the ground running. Um, you know what basketball is a business. The NBA is a business and they've made a decision. The only thing um I just wish I had known or had the opportunity to talk to somebody beforehand. Um, you know finding out through Twitter, through, through other people is a tough way to find out when you've been with a franchise for so long. Um, but you know at the end of the day, basketball is a business and I want to play where, where a team wants me and that's why I'm excited about being here. Um, no. At the time you know I think that was around the time when Melo was going through his whole thing in New York with, with the no trade clause and I don't think it was something that was, that was, uh, like a real option at the time. So, like I said I want to play for a franchise that wants me to be here and, and clearly they didn't so this is, this is what's most exciting to me. Uh, I think we can be very dominant. I mean we have to, we have to start working together and I've been a fan of Andre's game for a long, long time. I mean when he first came in you could see just how talented he was, just raw talent. And then watching his maturation over the course of his career has been has been awesome. You know, getting to to post moves and being able to finish in different ways and you know, he has way more skill than I think he probably gets credit for. Um, I'm not sure what you know people think I'm over here but, um, I know they love him but I know, I know that he's a better player than, um, I think people even realize it and they know he's and they know he's a good player. Yeah, I have a winter coat. I mean, yeah you know we travel all the time. I'm from Oklahoma so we had, we had actual seasons and winters so this is more like home than it was, um, then up in LA so I'm, I'm prepared.",2
"All right, all right. Yeah it was great to get a win. We came in off a one to one shoot around, uh, so you know these guys played hard and we'll keep getting better from here. Uh, yeah. You know just trying to give them a spark. Um, you know, we got guys, we've got guys that came to fit. You know, Dre was great around the rim but it's just the talk, the communication I think that we can get better and I thought we did a good job when it counted tonight. Yeah, I felt very comfortable. Coach Van Gundy has been great. I mean, these guys have been great. My biggest thing is I don't want them to sit so I don't want to take away anything that we do well already. I want to come in and fill in, fill in the pieces and, uh, they'll be there for us and when we need this. This crowd was awesome. This crowd was awesome. I mean, uh, you know Detroit is a sports city. Uh, they support their teams so well. This crowd you know, it was very loud. They were into the game when they should have been and, uh, yeah I can't wait to see it go from here. Yeah you know it's, it's, it's depending on game the game you know Dre is going to. He's going to attract a lot of attention so it's my job to to help get him open uh so you know. Going to the rim early, uh, trying to get to the free-throw line helps. And the defense even pulls over. Thank you.",3
"Um, I mean, I think uh, being - what it - having another teammate that went through a injury that kept him out for the year, knowing what it's like coming back from something and you're tryna, you know, be yourself and tryna, you know, get back to doing the - dominate the game the way you do, as he's done this year, I think the amount that he does in the game, and night after night the amount that he works, I think that load has to be watched. I belive it, just, you know, as you're climbing back, cause I don't think you want any setbacks, um, and that's just from mine, I'm not in the medical room or some meetings or anything - that's just from mine, that's the way I take it um, and I think he's extremely important to our team, as is everybody else um, so I mean whatever he needs to do to continue to progress, I think - we behind him one hundred percent. Um, I think it does a way more mentally for you than - than physically. Cause you probably need more than one night half the time, but I think the mental, uh, side of it, just giving a chance to take a breather and not try to figure out if something's nagging you, how you gonna get yourself going - how I'm gonna be able to play through this or that, or not get hit, or if I fall, how's it gonna feel, and things like that so, um, I think the mental side of it is - is definitely not talked about enough as far as that rest. And you think about a guy like Kawhi who in every facet of the game has so much on his mind, what he's playing through, and the double teams, and guarding the best guy, and... Coming down the stretch, he's trying to make plays for everybody, I think that helps him a lot. Um, I - I mean I think it just kinda - it just helps keep you fresh and allows you to continue to work too, on days like today you don't have to really worry about your load when you're in a situation like that, um, I mean and, it kinda changes your - your approach to the game some nights too, cause it's like I have no excuse now, I have to give it everything I've got, there's no pacing yourself, there's no - and you let the game come to you and, most nights, you don't get tired anyway, once you fall into the game. A lot of youth, uh, a lot of confidence with those young guys, uh, I think the head of the snake De'Aaron Fox has been a big part of that, and those other guys, just playing with a lot of energy and um, I think Shump's come over there and provided some toughness and some kinda - some grit and a little bit of uh, veteran presence from being on some winning teams in Cleveland, and things he's done, I think they're just kinda, you know - they understand the big picture of it. They understand that there's gonna be some growing pains, but they also understand that they can compete with anybody. And I think they come out every night, and they give it everything they've got, and the things they're - they're coming short on, aren't things of physical nature, it's just experience. Guys haven't been in situations, and learning the playing spots yet. Um, the biggest - like it - it's the mental side for me, the same thing, because I was struggling, you know, um, and it helped me, you know, mentally grasp what I was tryna do. And it gave me a chance to kinda slow everything down, watching film, watching games, and for myself personally, you know, it gave me a chance to take a breather and everyday you're obsessed with how am I gonna fix it, how am I gonna fix it, they gave you a chance, knowing that there was a date five days from now, whatever, that's expected to be reevaluated to come back, okay, so I got five days to kinda, decompress, figure out what's going on, how can I continue to get better in that time I'm off, and be ready when I come back. And that's what it did for me, the biggest thing was just taking that load off, and just kinda breathe, and step back into the game like it was the first game of the season. Just um, slowing down, understanding the pace, understanding the - playing with a purpose and pace but not being too fast, and I think I was able to just see things at a - at a good speed, but not to the point where it was everything at one, and I think that was a thing I was tryna do in the beginning and before these two games, and there's still a lot of work I gotta do, a lot of things I'm still tryna get better at, but, um, my biggest thing is just you know, step at a time, and as long as the steps' forward, it doesn't matter how big it is. No, um - Taking advantage of how people play me, and you know, trying to just use every attribute that I have, you know, um, size, strength, things that I work so hard to be able to have, to be able to do that during the season, and I'm just tryna make sure I keep it even and that way it makes everything else easier. And I know the first thing guys, when they come in the game, is run them off the line, so I'mma beat you to it - I'mma run by you, um, and - and then at the same time, you know, just tryna make the right reads. I think there's a balance. You gotta play your game. I think the biggest thing's always in your locker room first. Um, you know what they're gonna try to do, and I think you don't let them dictate it, um, I think the biggest thing is getting stops and running in opportunity, making sure that those - when you're running, you're in control of it, it's not just doing - just getting shots up because they're gettin shots up, I think it's all about the game plan	and what you can take from them and continue to play to our strengths.",1
"Uh, I mean I can't recall but, I mean, it's uh basketball it happens. I just think, you know, developing chemistry man. It's not easy to come out and just play, you know, and be fluent as things are being accustomed you know to. I think the more we play together, the more we figure each other out I think that'll you know ease up the turnovers. Yeah for sure. I mean guys have to play, guys have to be in the line up. Coach's job to keep mixing it up figuring out what works. Um, like I said, we got a lot of new guys a lot of guys trying to get their rhythm back, so its not gonna be that easy. Man he played with that energy. He brings a lot to the table. He can shoot it, score the ball, he can defend, rebounds well. He brings that energy, that um, you know you know teams need players like that. I mean I give credit to the vets in the locker room. You know. Coaches in locker room. You know. You so accustomed to winning things don't change when you lose, you know, you still gotta keep that same energy you know that same energy, you know, on and off the court that keeps them sane. So I give a lot of credit to those guys. Cool",1
"Um, I'm not sure. Honestly, I think, um you know as a team we we are a young team. So we're gonna have some ups and downs, you know I think that's what's kind of playing. We don't have a consistent. You know, effort. You know, I think we bring it. Then we don't then we lose like this and then we tomorrow, I mean next game maybe uh, might go out and win two in a row. You never know, what you know, what just with a young group. So I think it's just part of the, you know, the learning, the learning curve. Say that again. Uh, I mean it's tough. You know, we're playing the cards that were dealt. So it's not easy winning initially,um but what you can do is to continue to compete. Continue to you know what you do well as an individual, you know, learn where you can be better as an individual. And then hopefully, you know, I can just be a part of the meshing of, you know, other guys on the team. So like I said it's it's not easy winning in this league. Thankfully we got a young group that can compete and get all the way up to the two minutes of the game and then we may beat ourselves, you know, so that is what it is. He works for Utah? He is big dude, um so he definitely think you might have something and he might affect it you know with his length um. But he's been, you know, dominating the game on the defensive end for years now, so now as a veteran player I try to realize you know that and you know that it played to my advantage, but yeah, he definitely affects the game. Uh, I think it's a collective effort. You know um we got off to a slow start as a , you know. As the first five, the first unit that started the game, it's up to us you know. It's on us to give the second unit a you know good chance. But um I think it was like 8-21 at one point, I don't know, but it's hard to win games like that when you gotta dig out of a hole from the start, so you know it takes a collective effort, but it's definitely hard to start. Yeah for sure. I mean, um simple as that, yeah. Something you just to want to get rid of. Build on that Portland game. You know, as this one kind of did not happen. We didn't have the energy. We didn't get off to a great start. So like I said you know, dig in and call in to that.",0
"They develop bonds in this league, and when it when it goes like that we're humans it's hard for us to just like to go out and escape that so the best thing about those guys definitely missed. Who said that? It's just love. It's just love. It's just part of the business of the league, you know, as a team those are your brothers and not just guys that just get tossed around. So, no matter what the circumstances we always enjoy like being around guys that you can bond with and win we just go whatever it maybe. Yeah, I mean, I said I'll repeat myself, it is what it is uh. I've been in that situation plenty of times you kinda know how to go about it. Um that's something to not lose sleep over it. Cause at the end of the day you can't control it, it is what it is, what you make out of it too. Oh it was all love. I like said felt like home again. New York fans are amazing, so I uh appreciate it. Cool appreciate it",1
"It was great. Um it was great. Super excited about this group. You know uh you know what Karl does and what he brings to the table but just the group in general uh and uh the coaching staff looking forward for this challenge figuring out what we can do to get better. There's no right answer to that. I think just in general our pace on our offensive end and defensive end. DP is great at his communication and the quicker we can get film and get some games under our belt to uh to uh to be better I think that's in on our time. That's a great team over there. And they're obviously capable of great things, you know, Nick Nurse is a great coach. But in general I'm worried about us. The more we can better get some games under our belt and just dissect the film you know from being better individually, I think it will it will help our chemistry as a whole. Of course of course. Like I said, we know what we bring to the table. It's about dissecting the film and bringing it together. See how we can, you know, take the weight off each other shoulder down the stretch. I believe in him to make the play and vice versa For sure. Like I said, it's a whole new group. You know so chemistry is gonna develop within time and time is on our side. We're not in a playoff race or anything like that uh. We're just gonna worry about us on what games like I said and practice and more film session the better we'll be.",2
"Um, yeah I mean just watching him uh, since I was young uh, just first uh, just remember the dunks he did and um, and then um, just how long his career's been, so that's really the furtherest memory I can - I have of him. Definitely, definitely. Um, you know especially with a guy that jumps a lot, you know their - I feel like their careers usually don't go as long but I feel like he uh, he um, you know, worked on - worked on his shot, became a shooter, scorer, um and he was able to last in the NBA. Yeah. Um, I just remember I feel like the earliest one is - or the one that most - that's more - that's most memorable is uh, when he put his arm in the rim, that was probably like, where I really gravitated to him. Uh I feel like right now it hasn't, because uh, Fred started, you know we have - we didn't really play that much together but I don't think - but um - you know I feel like uh, it'll just, you know, just be back - be like old times, so that's just, you know, playing off each other and uh, tryna you know, [inaudible] split our matchup. Yeah I think it's very important to us, obviously we wanna have that chemistry going into the playoffs, so uh, it's always good to have both two back in the lineup and um, you know just keep - continue to build with each other. Yeah I feel like we're in, you know, a good spot uh, I think still first um, so that's always good um, you know obviously we gave some games up that we would have liked to, you know, get back but you know happens and we - we've been dealing with a lot of injuries, so you know it kinda happens. Individually or as a team? Uh, just you know being consistent as a individual and um, as a team staying together, moving the ball, playing good defense and um, you know just building good habits. Uh, yeah just, I don't know it's been a little different with like minutes and rotations, so it's been a little different for me but um, you know, I just have to, you know fight through the little things and uh, try to do my best. Uh, I don't know. It could be, I don't know. Um, but, you know just have to deal with it uh, that's with the team we have and um, you know just to play I have to do my best. Uh yeah, I mean, you know, he's a hall of famer so of course uh, that'll be always good to have a hall of famer on a team, but um, you know until that happens uh, just be uh, I'll just admire him afar. Uh, scored thirty thousand I believe, against us - Twenty five? Sorry twenty five. That - you know that's - that's amazing and um, just the carer he's had uh, one of the best or arguably the best in-game dunkers so, I just think that um, with all those accolades uh, he - he'll get in. Just try to, you know, take the good, um, and just kinda learn from them as much as I can um, obviously I won't be able to take everything from those individuals, so just try to take little pieces and, you know, add in wherever I feel like I need it.",2
"Yeah I feel like uh, the first unit, they were playing really fast so we just had to come in and uh, you know, keep the - keep the pace up um, and that's pretty much what we did. I mean it's always good um, never want to see anybody uh, struggle, he was kind of in like a little struggle uh, earlier, now he's kind of finding his - his shot uh, ways to get open. Uh, I mean I feel like everybody's starting to pick it up, um kind of finding our rhythm and uh, you know, just tryna do a good job of, you know, playing together and, you know, hitting uh, wide open shots.",0
"Honestly, it was something that we don't even think about because uh, you know, any different - any given day you can be beaten by a team that's played on a back to back or had a lot of rest. Honestly didn't even know that but uh, it's a good stat I guess uh, just you know - I guess you're taking advantage of that and um, keep getting those wins. Yeah we kept fouling uh, giving them uh, easy uh - giving them free throws and like layups, and I feel like once we started to get stops in second quarter uh, it was able - it was - it enabled us to start running and uh, getting, uh, layups on the other end. Very important. Um, you know, it was on national TV and uh, I feel like we just dropped the ball so I feel like with us bouncing back uh, it kind of gave us, you know, some, you know, good momentum going into our next couple games. Um, keep that same feeling um, we know when you lose, you know, kind of mask and keep that same feeling and um, you know just play with that same fire when we come home and play Philly. Um, I mean it could be a different - different things but I think our effort wasn't even there, we watched some - some of the film and like we were like kinda like jogging around, you know, not taking it serious so, I just think that um, whoever's on the court just, you know, have to play. We've done it all year with uh, guys being out. Yeah, both. Um, cause I think we do a good job when - I think we held them to under a hundred - uh, Milwaukee game, so I feel like our offense needs to pick it up and um, you know defense will, defense obviously there too.",1
"Yeah, initially figuring out where I was going um, and then the next day we came from Atlanta to here and really just being getting acclimated with a - kind of learn the system, learn new faces, and um, you know, everything at that [inaudible] come up with. Uh yeah I - I - I've been a big fan, um obviously since um, you know, the Tony Allen days uh, the playoff runs you guys had, or what we had now um, so I just, you know, I'm happy to be here and um, you know I'm just ready to get to work. Um I feel like when - when I go ut there and play, it'll be like kinda easy to figure out, I don't want to pinpoint one thing, that's - we're gonna let them figure it out. Not really, not yet. Um, kind of I - I just met them today so, and just been trying to learn to plays and stuff like that, you know, that's a lots to learn, so I feel like over the course of the regular season uh, you know, I'll get to know him. Yeah I mean - Always talking to stack um, so you know he's - he's been with me since I - I was - I will - believe my rookie year, so you know, I'm kind of familiar with him, Burno too. I mean it's good because, you know, I feel like you get a little more comfortable um, with the knowing people and knowing faces, uh, how they operate and know they can kind of ease you into it so uh, you know I think it's gonna be a good thing.",1
"Oh yeah definitely, um, I feel - feel like the first day, the day I played uh, that was the first day I was able to get on the court um, even go over offense, so I'm a lot more comfortable uh, with that under my belt. Yeah it reminds me of like AAU days and high school days where you're going to a camp and you know just learn the offense, and then you gotta go play and uh, you know, be a good teammate. Yeah so I play uh, they just put it in uh, as we came in so it's uh, a more of a spread offense I like that um, you know, able to make your own decisions and, you know, don't have to be in a specific spot so, um so far um, I like it. Yeah that's pretty much what um, I'm looking forward to is able to run off but also play alongside Mike um, and just learn from him so um, I think we could be good together. I did both, um, when I was in with Fred uh, I was kind of the off ball, but when I was in with Kyle, I kinda was able to be the ball handler so, I'm able to do both and um, whatever, you know, whatever role they need me to do uh, I'll be happy to do it. Uh, comfortable. Um, you know sometimes it's different because I'm used to making uh, the - the passes to the, you know, spot up shooters and then um, you know, as the years won't - been going on, I've been able to know that I have to be that shooter and not the facilitator. Oh yeah definitely. Um, cause I feel like we're learning, we're figuring each other out uh, it's not like I'm coming in and I'm trying to step on anybody toes, like you know, taking anybody, you know, roles or anything, so I feel like we all learn it together, um, with it being so many of us that's new.",3
"I mean, it was a big win for us, uh, snapping a four game losing streak, um, and you know just getting back on our feet and uh, trying to move forward. Yeah, we played good together, I feel live we've been playing well since we got together, but just tryna figure each other out, and um, finish games off strong, so, I think that was important that we finished off the game today. Yeah, he did a good job of picking him up, and uh, making - making it tough on him uh, didn't let him just get to the basket, he took some tough shots, so uh, credit to him and also a good uh team help defense. Yeah I mean it is, uh, just hasn't translated to wins, but I think we're doing a good job of playing together and figuring out the new system, um, and just you know, trying to figure out each other individually. Thank you.",3
"Uh, I was just trying to get downhill initially, I seen the time, um, and I figured we could - we might [inaudible] go for a two for one and possibly take the lead, so I try to get there - get down there soon as possible, they did a good job of cutting it off initially, uh, my second time going it was open so I made a layup. Right. Um, just - just trying to uh, earn my respect in this league. He had scored - he had got a free throw on me uh, three free throws and I told him stop flopping, and then he told me he was gonna get a straight up bucket on me, and uh, on the last play I told him I ain't the one to iso, and then that - that's what it is. Um, not really, I was just trying to make him uncomfortable. You know, I didn't really want him settling into his moves, uh just jab at the ball as much as possible, if I get a hand on it uh, you know that's extra, but I just want to make him uncomfortable. Um, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that, uh, my main thing right now is just going out and playing as hard as possible, and I feel like uh, if I do that, you know I - I'll get some good karma, just - just trying to make myself tired and play as hard as I can. Uh, should be a lot of fun, we just played each other tonight uh, we got the win, I'm sure they gonna come out fired up, we gottta come out and match their energy on the road and we wanna look and - look to turn around our uh road record. For sure, for sure Appreciate it. Yeah yeah, so I had a runny nose, a mean cough, stomach hurting, headache, little fever, I run a fever about a hundred ten degrees [inaudible]. So when we landed I was - I was just back to normal. Serious. Close. I was on the brink. I was on the brink bro. Um probably about forty. Forty, just get a lot of postgame passes, um give em to my brother, he'll hand them out to people at the game. Yeah. We come back? Oh oh. Um, that would be cool man, that would be cool, uh we'll see how it go I'm glad they having it here, I think that'd be big for the state uh, I think a lot of people in the city would come out to that so I - I think it'd be pretty dope. Nah, nah. I'm good on that. Hopefully the uh - I don't know, I ain't even be hearing anything about it, you know, so I - I ain't heard too much about it. Nah it was fun, it was - I said that last year, I said it was - it was fun, it's a something I'll probably - nah actually I said I won't wanna do it, that's what I said. It was fun, I had a good time man, I just enjoy being around, uh, the - the company of the - the high level NBA players, you know, it's - it's pretty cool to be around them. Uh uh. Uh uh. It's a - it's a - I mean you don't - you don't really think about all that, everybody say the crowd and all that - what up my boy - everybody say the crowd and all that that, but it's really uh, they give you a boost, adrenaline boost, energy boost, so it's all good. Uh I wouldn't say that, um, I like playing in Dallas, I like playing at home - Yeah, just having all the family. Yeah I - I like that, I enjoy that. I know they enjoy it, uh I getta hang with them a little bit before the game, a little bit after so that's always great. Last night? Only like eight. Like eight people. You know my barber came up um, I'm getting about twenty five maybe thirty, there's gonna be a lot of people here, just give them postgame passes. Yeah. We'll see. I ain't um, I ain't sure yet. I hope I make the uh what's it - the world versus US game, you know, that'd - that'd be cool to play in that. Yeah. I don't think Luka would jump. I don't think he'll jump. Um, yeah I mean we want to make the playoffs. We were uh, we were sixth in the West for a good portion of time, I missed some time and uh, you know it was - it was a little struggle, we got to pick it back up, get some road wins. We take care of business at home, so it's just about getting wins on the road. Yeah, for sure for sure. Uh we got two more games in road after this, against two really good teams, I think if we get a win tonight, uh we can - we can get some momentum moving forward. Yeah. Uh, I salute him, he killed - he killed in college. Um, Kansas him and Frank Mason they were uh, one of the best back courts, in college um, [inaudible] he's a really good player, good dude, we hooped a lot this summer when I came up to Riley, uh you - you know he's just a high level competitor, he deserves to be in the league. Go to the post. Go to the post. Yeah. I mean, how special is that for you, and I know he said that he thought it neat that your parent's knew his sky nickname, cause not everyone here calls him [inaudible].",2
"Uh, my teammates did a good job of making shots um, they set me up for a couple - I'm alright? Um, they set me up for a couple of boards as well, they boxed their man out so uh, it was a team effort to get it. Yeah, I ain't know until he told me, you know, so um, you know, then - then I just started to pick it up a little bit from there, but uh, like I said, it was a real team effort, they helped me get it. Nah, um, I think DJ asked him to sub me back in and then um, it was actually a couple people on the bench that asked him to sub me back in, and uh you know after I got it, I just - I knew I was coming out, which was fine with me, but um, like I said, it was a team effort from everybody. Right. Uh, good ball movement, we were making shots tonight, uh, we got a lot of really good looks, we knew they were blitzing, and um, you know we executed. Oh yeah, that was uh - that was great to see man, great to see. If you see the work that he puts in on a daily basis, to see him come out and do something like that tonight, um, that's major, you know everybody was happy for him. Yeah, uh, he was hot. He was hot. Like I said, everybody's making shots. Wesley was on fire - he had five threes in the first half? Shit. Yeah, he was - he was on fire tonight, HB was getting it to the paint, um, DJ was staying on the rim, finding guys, uh, [inaudible] came in with the energy, you know, we just - we did a really good job tonight from top to bottom. Uh, it's really just trying to attack at every chance that I get. Really, and uh, just go from there, just trust myself to make the correct read, but I - I gotta keep attacking. Uh it was dope man, that's - that's the uh, that's the first game that bro came to check me out, so um, you know, he told me - he told me to have really good game tonight, you know he wanted to see a little show, we got the win and um, you know I had a solid game, so it was - it was really good to see him out there tonight. Been a minute.",2
"Um, it's my family uh, older sister, um older cousins, you know they just never let me have it easy, so anything I wanted I had to take it and uh, that's how I was brought up. Nah he was just doing - you know, doing a lot of things that wasn't really um related to basketball, you know and - you know, uh, you know he know me I ain't - it's - you know I'm just saying like just keep it hoop, you know, if you want to hoop just keep hooping, uh if it's anything else then let it be known uh, but other than that just play basketball. Yeah. Toughness on the defensive end uh, and LT was major for us tonight with that uh, he came with the energy and uh, you know he inspired me to pick up my talking on the defensive end and uh, you know, that's just something that we got to start the game with, that level of intensity and - and that level of - of caring, um, you start like that we coulda got a win tonight, uh and it's been like that for the last few games.",2
"Feel good, feel good, uh it's a long time coming um, we was on a streak, and to go into all-star break breaking that streak I think it's gonna be major for us moving forward. Uh we got a lot of competitors in the locker room, as well as our staff, so uh it's a great feeling, it's a great feeling. Uh, coach spoke on it earlier, we had to come out as a desperate team, desperate men, uh like I - like I said it's been a long time coming since we got a win, we just had to lock in, make every hustle play um, not dwell on the negative, just give it all we got. Yeah. Uh, it mean a lot, it mean a lot. I came in wearing the hat that say New York or nowhere so uh, I'mma try to get a win and bring it back to Madison Square Garden.",3
"Um, it's major. We' ve been having our fans come out support every night and uh, we haven't won here since December first, and I wasn't a part of that one so I'm - I'm glad that we could get it tonight and um, just get a fan something to see. You know that's the least we could do is get a win for them they've been supporting every night so it was major for us to win it tonight. Yeah. Um, I mean he's a great shooter -  he's a great shooter uh, you know and I know he's gonna put him up so I try to find him. He's - he was hot last game, he was hot this game as well, so he does a great job of getting open and knocking down shots and uh, he's super aggressive so anytime I can find him I'm looking for him. Right. Just energy and effort on both ends um, I thought we had a pretty productive practice yesterday um, you know me and coach we had a really long meeting prior to practice and uh, just hashing out the things that he needs me to do and - and um you know and if he told me if I come in to execute those things in the game we'll get a win and that's what happened tonight.",2
"I think I just play with a sense of urgency. Um, I think guys started demanding a little bit more, uh, we move the ball well in offense, but we communicate a lot better on defense. I mean, definitely. So, you know, anytime you, you got things going on and in-organization-wise you kind of, play a little bit better that first game. So, I think, you know, I just had that energy and um mainly was just trying to get a win for our hometown team. Uh, you can't focus on this one now you gotta move on to the next one. Um, there's still so much stuff that we can get better on. You know, offensively, moving the ball and not taking bad shots. Defensively communicating and not trying to get as many breakdowns we had tonight so. Uh, we just gotta figure out and watch film. Um, pass first offence. You know, I think we're still dribbling the ball a lot, you know, I still think we're forcing a lot of shots and even when we're going to the basket, you got three or four guys challenging shots where you have open guys on the outside. So, uh, we gotta continue to watch film and get better and see, you know, times where you should have made the pass rather than trying to force a shot. And defense we're doing the same thing. You know, just miscommunication breakdown and things like that. How we can get better? You know what, I don't know what to say. It's not like we have to respond well to LD. You know, I think it's pretty much the same thing it's just that, that game where everything plays better after you know things go, go wrong in an organization where you know guys may not be here, but it's the same team we had when Ty was here. It's just a different ballgame today, I guess.",1
"He's a, he's a tough guard. You know, he can do a lot of things as far as driving. A great shooter, so we have our hands full but it's not just gonna be focused on me, it's gonna be a team effort. There's a lot of things we can improve on, you know. Communication is key, getting back in transition, uh, moving the ball, you know. Um, not necessarily settling for the good shot but trying to find the great shot. And, you know, as a young team, we have to learn that and, uh, when we learn those things we will be alright. I mean just find it, there's smart ways to do it. You know, there's a time and place for all that stuff when to push it and when not to push it. [Inaudible] when to take maybe a contest shot, when not to. So, um, we have to take it for what it is, try to, you know, let our defense spark our offense and then take it from there",1
"I mean definitely. So, you know, we felt like we played a great game and you know gave ourself a chance to win and you know having some of our you know mistakes down the stretch was, it was costly. But you know, we learned from it you know we move on. Um, some things didn't go our way. Ball didn't bounce our way. Calls didn't go our way. You chalk it up. This sucks. Like losing you, you fight so hard to win a game like that and then sometimes it gets taken from you. Um, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. So you know, we gotta watch film and gotta learn how to get better down the stretch. Um, you know, play that we could have avoided and things like that but that's what we're doing. You know, we're a young team and we're learning as we go and you know, I'll take the effort today. Just trying to win the game. You know, I don't really care about anything else but to win, you know. Playing the right way, moving the ball, defending at a high level. I'm just having fun out there. Um, but tonight sucks, you know this one sucks. I mean, he's a basketball player. He knows, he knows situations, you know. Maybe, you know, I take a little bit on my blame, too, you know, on my shoulders. Um, probably shouldn't made the pass to put him in that position, um, so it's not just him and it's not just that one play. So kind of had a good play. Felt like he, you know, got fouled and things like that but it didn't go our way. So, we live, we learn, we move on for a minute. Uh, and focus on the next one. I mean I think that guys play their hearts out. You know, I think guys played hard. I think guys move the ball well today. You know, looked out for each other, and play for each other and anytime you do that you're gonna give yourself a chance to win.",1
"I think that, you know, we're trying to do things you know off the court to get, you know familiar with each other know each other and things like that. But I think it was good that you know, you get those days to rest your body. Got a perfect opportunity to come up here little earlier do something for the community but at the same time kind of get locked in. Definitely. So I think guys you know once they're playing every other day or every two days they get into that rhythm but you know four day break is kind of a long day because even when you're practicing you're not really getting those in-game reps. So, they can't but like I said, you got to focus on the task come out with some energy, well you should come out if you've been off four days so that's going to be the focal point. Well, we're young so I think you know given the young guys four days off should, should embark a lot of energy. But at the same time, you know we're playing for something to get better each and every game and anytime we can try to do that this is just another step in the direction where we want to go to get off the good starts, play the right way and have fun doing it. We're still learning. You know it's a very very young team, an experienced team, so we're still learning every day. Still talking to all the young guys and trying to put them in the best situation they can possibly be in but, um, just being here you know you see everyone's coming together everyone's listening a lot better, taking things in like a sponge now. Well, I think we're definitely starting to play through the past, trusting one another a lot more. I don't think that was there early in the season. Um, I think we're passing the ball better, I think we're communicating a little bit better. There's still a lot of things we gotta get better on transition defense. Um just picking up a man, not so caught up into my man isn't scoring, but how can I help the team defensively? So once we start getting those things knocked in, you start to see better play. You defend. You know, I think you know Detroit is one of the top teams offensively to me you know they have a lot of guys who can score the ball too high rate and we have to cut off the head of the snake and Blake Griffin. But you also got to keep Drummond off the board. So, anytime we can do that, keep their guards you know [inaudible] and Reggie Jackson out the paint dumping off to those guys, I think we're being good stance but that's probably a lot for the camera to say. But, um, we have multiple things that we have to do to, to get that but folks want a defensive me and don't worry about offense.",1
"I mean sometimes you gonna have those games. You know, where as things not going well, you're not making shots. Um, they're going to run and things like that but, um, I just showed the maturity and the [inaudible] in this team, the poise in this team to continue to fight continue to get stops, and, and pull out a win. I mean, yeah. You know, this, this team is are, already great. So, to try to come into this team and try to find your own, where you have a lot of, you know, guys that's already, you know, doing what they what they got to do. Um, it's tough but you know it's fun to be a part of it and I continue to get better",0
"I think we didn't communicate well with some pick-and-roll stuff. Uh that's part of that is muffled and uh went under few times and they were able to hit some shots. Uh I think that was that was the biggest part. Yeah I mean uh good communication is big and uh pick-and-roll defense and uh sometimes I didn't talk it out loud sometimes we we messed up calls and that's what happens if his shots though those are a really good players on the on the Memphis team. They hit tough shots and uh that's it. Uh I mean basically like the last game uh I was playing off the LeBron and my teammates uh they were I was setting the screen so LeBron was getting deep into paint uh and my guy had to help so he would serve the ball for me and I would just have to finish it so I think that helped us uh to get some together paint tight. And we got some uh wide open shots from that but we were not able to make them. I'm just trying to go straight up. Uh one of my problems problems was reaching for the ball. But uh I know the team needed me so I had to stay straight up go straight up for the block and when I do that I'm a big guy I got a big wingspan and so when I do that it's tough to finish over me. It felt really good. Uh it's a big part of what we do over here and just him go down it was it was really bad so to see him to see him getting better it was really good for the things. No, not really Luke Luke's always been saying to me that he he trusts me. And uh if uh there's a chance to put me on the floor, he he's gonna put me there and uh he's gonna always trust me like every other player on the team. And I just been I've been doing the same stuff every day.  Uh working hard, doing everything to stay in shape. So when Luke trusted me with a opportunity, I got to take full I gotta take full advantage of it. A few weeks into season, I was feeling really bad in uh training camp. And, that was a that was a time that was the time to show the coaches what I got. I can help the team and I was not able to do that because I got sick. And uh took me some time to get back in shape but uh when I got back in shape I was I was doing really good in uh practices. So that's why that's why coach the coach Luke had trust in me. Yeah, yeah that's that's how I was feeling all summer and uh that's that was the goal for this season to play like this every single night. But uh unfortunately I got sick in training camp and I was not able to do it",0
"That's tough to guard but uh we could have uh done a better job defending him. Uh having a higher pickup point uh [inaudible] tracking him on the screens on the pick-and-roles. And you know just helping out our guards. But uh we didn't do those things and he got,  that's tough to defend. I mean I think everyone knows their role uh you know we just I think, I think we played good in the first half. Uh we could have done much better job and we were only down by ten, And I think we had our chances but uh we we came out slow in the third. That's where, that's where it was over. Yeah uh, I think I did good uh I mean I'm trying I'm trying to get better on defense uh every every day especially on the post defense. that was that's one of my weaknesses and I working. Tyson is helping me a lot a lot with that and you know I think I did pretty good. it will be great. He was one of our leaders. And, with him being on the floor it's it's much easier especially for me, as a big, I always know what to do, where to be you and know he's gonna help us a lot. I mean you always gotta watch the tape. Uh, we gotta see where we made our mistakes, but at the same time you gotta you got to be ready, you gotta prepare for the next game. You gotta forget all about this uh learn from these mistakes and move on. You gotta get the ball out of uh, out of his hands. You gotta do put the like on the pick-and-rolls. You gotta trap him. You gotta have a high pickup point. You gotta just make him play inside of the three-point line",1
"Uh, this was one of the games like, we were prepared we, we knew we needed to win this game and uh we came out ready. First quarter a little slow but uh after that we we took the lead and after that, we didn't let them get back in the game. Uh I was boxing out. I was boxing out my guy. My teammates were boxing out their guys, so there was no there was no guard their guards couldn't fly in and disrupt the the boards, and so I just had to go and get it. Uh, we did, we wanted to double uh Booker on the screens and to to make him get rid of the ball and we we did that pretty good and we we made other guys make make the plays. Uh, it was it was great uh you know we we all know what Lance can do and like he's making those shots it's much easier to win the game. Uh, I had to uh prepare extra and you know his one of the best big guys in the league so, yeah I'll have Tyson to help me out [inaudible]. What what kind of defense to play what was the best way to play against him. And I'm gonna come out ready. We knew, we knew they didn't have [inaudible], so we knew they don't have any rim protection so our game plan was like get in the paint, like stop shooting threes, get in the paint. They don't have any rim protection now we started doing that, they started collapsing into the paint and then we we had open threes and finally we made some, this time. You know in practice we will always prepare the day before, we prepare for the team who who we got next. so every time so we got Joel Embiid we're gonna we're gonna put a ball in a post in a practice and Tyson is gonna help me out on a you know like on the floor he's gonna help me out how to defend him what side should I make him go what uh well what are his moves and you know he is always there to help me so I if I got any question I asked him and he's always happy to help. Yeah, we knew what we gotta do. We knew we gotta win this game and uh we we came out ready to play. We played hard and uh, we never gave them the chance to win the game. Oh yeah for sure, I mean especially when he's hitting the shots. So you know that that gives a fuel to to all the players and uh everyone's having fun on the floor everyone's happy to go back on defense get another stop and then going off and make another shot and you know that's how it goes every time we have a good offensive possession it's easier to go back on defense and get ready to make a stop.",2
"It felt really good. Uh, it didn't feel like the first time playing with the team. Uh, it felt like I played a game before with them. And uh you know, guys were helping me out-- what to do uh on offense, where to move, and stuff like that. And it was pretty easy. I mean, that's one of the biggest strengths of my game. Uh pick-and-roll. And when I set a screen, I always roll hard. And you know, either I'm open, or the handler, or the guy in a corner. Someone's going to get open. And I'm going to be sticking to that. Yeah. Uh just basic stuff, like play hard. Like, we knew we knew, we turned a lot of uh. We turned the [inaudible]. We turned over the ball a lot. And uh you know, they were scoring a bunch of points uh off of turnovers. And we knew that's one of the biggest issues. And you know we were sharing the ball on uh on offense, playing hard defense, setting hard screens, and just like playing hard. And we were able to get back.",3
"I'm gonna stay in LA. I mean I mean, my house. I'm staying in the same arena. You know? But uh after I took [inaudible] a little bit [inaudible]. Uh, not really. I mean, I think I just, only when we were to play them in, like, a few games before our game. Like, to see the way they play. But at the end [inaudible]. Yeah. Uh, transition was very easy. Gotta learn some new plays, and still gotta make sure how to [inaudible] Clipper players. How the players play. Uh What their game's like. But uh you know, I think I'll fit in good. Oh, yeah. They [inaudible] really. Uh It's different. It's different. Very different. can't compare it.  Huh? Colors. Yeah. When I was with the Lakers, when I would get out, it's like, everything was uh purple and gold. And it's it's just different. Kind of [inaudible]. Everyone's uh everyone's helping me out. And uh and it's a great game. Everyone was there to help me. Everytime I asked a question, there's five guys who were willing to help me, so Uh, he was there in my rookie year. You know, I got a lot of help from him, how to do it professionally, and how to work out everyday, how to how to prepare for every game. And you know, we had a good connection because we were both coming off the bench. We were running a lot of pick and roll, and we really had a good connection. So I did a lot with him my rookie year. It's been great. Uh everyone [inaudible] really good. [inaudible] And I really enjoy it. Uh feels good I mean I started the last five six games with the Lakers It's know. But uh you know, they expect more from me here. Uh I'm ready to deliver. Uh just playing hard for the team every night. I'm gonna do my best. I'm gonna try to keep the ball out of the paint. I'm gonna try to finish strong and just play hard.",1
"I feel good you know last year we had that feeling and on this year we don't want to have same something like last year. No we had a team meeting and uh, basically we just promised each other that we was gonna play harder. You know, uh, focusing more on defense and just move the ball more on offense and, um, just come together as a team. I'll tell you, a lot of you know um I started doing great job getting us going um so the benches I tried to come in and keep that going keep that same intensity that same energy. I think last game we did a great job doing that. Um I like it so it flew by. Me having the injury earlier on down here that we always had halfway through the season one I can't believe it went by fast but uh I don't even know what to say right now but grind. You know we just got to grind through everything we're going through out of there first. We needed that you know um Marc, he's our leader. Him and Mike, man. Marc played like that every game he made the game easy for everybody else and the team you know we follow his lead you know uh he had a great amount of energy throughout the whole game, was everywhere on the floor, offensely and defensively so we just need him to do that every game. You know, we've been better than how we've been playing lately you know um we show how good of a team we are earlier on throughout season which is going through adversity right now but we will fight through it and get back up and [inaudible]. He's like my little brother you know he's goofy. You know he always keeps smile on his face and everybody else face. We need that locker room special throughout the hard times and the tough times we've been going through but you know, um, I took him under my wing we just buddies you know. He's always laughing I heard I just seem to come in about lateness and all that so you know, that's Jaren. Yeah, I mean, uh, early on coming in you got a pad that many times you know to make each other better but the reason is that we're a team, we're brothers. You know, it's nothing bigger than that. Um, man, I'm a little upset about all of that right now so no comment but no, we're going to bounce back next year. You know we're gonna be right back at the same place and we're gonna win this year. I'm positive. Yeah man, but it's Alabama you're talking about. Man [inaudible] saying it's some fluke I don't fluke. I'll say it right here, it's a fluke. Fluke.",2
"Very frustrating like the last couple games we'll be winning but teams have just been able to pull it off on us so we just got to find a way to get stops. Um, it's difficult. It's business though so everybody know what time it is so we just trying to take one day at a time just see how everything here play out. Man, you know um they very big and important to the city you know to us and uh they mean a lot to this team so uh I gotta say it just a difficult situation and uh it's just business and so just going to see how I play. Um you know it's pretty much out but uh everybody pretty much knew about it. Um, room is flowing around and everybody talking so it's already out there. I don't know, man. I don't know. It's like a hex on us or something right now. You know the last two years, just going to have to see how it plays out.",0
"Lou. You know, a lot of teams focus in on him. And with Trez rolling to the goal, it just leaves me open in the wing or in the corner and knock it down. Yes. I just believe when you got Lou in the game, just a dangerous scorer. So teams really lock in on that and want the players, you know, step up. I know defense is going to keep me here so, you know, I'm just locked in on it. So anything, any mission coach want to put me on, I'm down for it. Just the moving. Having, you know, being in new relationships, I'm new to a nice organization, you know, with a couple of players I already knew and, you know, I'm fitting right in. No, no, not at all. No problem.",1
"Um, you know we've just been fine. Not laying down, winning games. Just have something really to compete for. Um, you know I just fit in with uh the defensive mindset, the toughness and um just the energy and the effort. You know, um, we're a big energy team, you know we have a lot of great pieces that can come together and um, yeah I feel like we can start to gel. Yeah Yeah, it is. Lou Williams and Gallinari, um, that's a tough team to beat. Um, my toughness, you know, uh um, not backing down, just taking those chances, just always competing. We're just going to step it up and defend. You know gotta slow em down, can't have 'em be going early on offense. Keep balls out of their hands and make the, the other players beat us tonight. Um, I would probably say college. You know being down there in Alabama [inaudible] uh towards my last three years, two or three years we was a defensive team and uh, I feel like we got to steal to be around there too. Um, I was a big uh Amar'e Stoudemire and Kevin Garnett uh so those were some players that I looked up to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, we got good work. Can't get, get uh satisfied. Always keep working. Always have to keep it up. [Inaudible] that's it. Um, [inaudible], you know uh, those two are similar players, you know, with our mindset to go into the game [inaudible] it's been working. Um, respect all fear none. Respect all, fear none. My dad. Mhm. Yeah, most definitely, and other stuff with. Yeah. Um, you know we just trying to get the job done, get as high as possible, get everyone on board, and just run. I'm Green, power forward.",1
"Yup, they were ready to fight. They were ready to battle. Back and forth type game. Uh, they just crafting a few balls out late and decided the game. Yeah, you gotta be tough though. Yeah, you gotta, you gotta be very resilient. Very, um, you gotta step up to the plate with those guys on the [inaudible]. Um, I think I fit in because I try to bring it each and every night. Um, with the physicality of the game I think it fits well with how I play. Very fun. Very fun to be a part of. Uh, two good, two great teams going head to head. Can't ask for anything more. It's very fun to be a part of and I can't wait for the next match up. Tough on our offensive end and for us. Uh, but I think good teams find a way to win that game. You know, uh, I think we're, we're working on being a good team we have our time but I think you got a lot of work to do. And um, like I say good teams find a way to win on the road and other aspects of the game. Uh, I think, like I said I think fifty fifty balls they're late. A couple of rebounds in late didn't go our way and it was a side effect of the game. Wasn't about shot making, it wasn't about anything else it was about being a little more snappier than those guys and we didn't do it. We didn't step up to the plate tonight.",2
"It was a great feeling. Happy, I was happy for him. Uh, just, just seeing the work he's put in and where he came from, from last year. To see his work pay off and be able to get a chance to get suited up was a great feeling for me. Oh he still got it. He still has it. Um, maybe his condition is a little, uh, not what he used to be but it'll come. Just like, uh, I think you shoot the ball even better from three. I'd say, uh, his legs were not as much as they wanted to be but he still got his powers. He'll be fine. Exactly, we got to keep, keep including him in our in our game plan but at the same time he's not on the court we got to continue to get better and do what we got to do. Uh, a lot of course his capability on offensive end draws a lot of attention. Um, I need to get great guys they give guys like myself and Kev, uh, uh, the opportunity to even help our team even more on the offensive end. So, it'd be fun to watch but just keep it and bring him alone as time goes and don't force him to do anything. Um, I'm glad he picked tonight, uh, to play. Sit out to back-to-back but he'd be fine. He'll help us out on the road trip moving forward. I told him, yeah, I told him to be, do, do him. Do yourself, like uh, myself I had a hard time just being myself at first. It was just, it was taking a little, taking me a little time but obviously you can tell he [inaudible] sub tonight and that's what the team needs. Myself? Oh, I'm ready to get the win. I'm not going to be, into all the, the hoopla, so I'm ready to get the win. Uh, lock in to these guys and, and our game plan moving forward. Um, get this back to back going. Maybe when I touch the, imma touch the court. Right now? No. Uh, I'll sleep fine tonight. I'll be ready to go tomorrow. I think when I hit the court, who knows. We'll see. He's not done yet. He's just getting started and when I told him to be yourself, be himself that's him being himself. That's a prime example.",3
"Uh, I believe so. Uh, my sister sent Obviously, like I said, I've Well, he's helped me out a lot with There's something, just to be different.",1
"I just thought it was a cheap shot. Um, one hundred precent. Never went up, never went for the ball. Just checking. The rest is history. Uh, you stick up for your teammates. Um, I want to be a part of this family and I know that being a part of it is sticking up for your brother and playing for one another. And that's what I'm about. Um, that's what I'm playing and I hope someone would do it for me. Um, I just felt like it was a bad play. I lost my cool a little bit. I disagreed with the call, gotta have a tech. That's all. Yeah, we were getting open shots, we get shots when we wanted but did lock up and get stopped late. We were finishing one. We limit, we limited those guys to, uh, one shot at the basket. Uh, they the best offensive rebound team in the league. So [inaudible] game [inaudible] limit those guys to one shot, we should have, we should have a good shot at beating those guys. Nah. He's he's a competitor, he's a trash talker. All of the above. He wishes he was out there competing in a game like that. That's what's probably eating him the most. He wishes he was on the court, fighting with his guys, but, um, that's my guy.",0
"It's fun, you know, to be a part of and go through it. Um, focusing on one game and to hone in on, as a group, on one game, that's complicated. It's pretty cool to be a part of you know. But we playing for something each night, uh, it's been a fun process for us to grow. Uh, we put it to the test [inaudible], especially with the road trip we just had. So, it's fun to be a part of. You take one game at a time. I know we have a good opportunity to take advantage of it. Um, we [inaudible] take one game at a time. [Inaudible] trip right now. Um, and right now, it's, it's a good opportunity for us to just take advantage of what we're going to do. Pretty much, uh, playing off long, learning how to play off one another. A lot of, a lot of, a lot of times a lot of guys on the court play off one another. Uh we'll [inaudible]. Uh, it's been fun to, each game, grow with these guys on the court. Uh, learn what they do, learn how to play off another guy. It's been fun, man. Also, the play calls have been a challenge for me. Getting our plays down. Uh, it's been a little challenge but it's fun. I actually did not know that. Um, that stuff is going to change. We, like I said, we have to take care, we have to take care of our business and that's each game, um, try to get the win. Um, rest up and take care of yourself but uh, we have a good opportunity to handle this. Uh, probably more here. More here in different names. Usually the League doesn't say name calls for a lot of different players. Names here a lil' different. It makes it, it, a little challenging to learn but it's fun. Uh, at least the opposing team don't know what you running everytime down the court so it's fun. Uh, same, same stuff but it feels cool. These guys do a great job with offensive rebounding.  I think Drummond averages five or something like that or four. So we gotta keep those guys off the glass and uh limit those guys to one shot, you know. [Inaudible] teammates for those guys, keep those [inaudible] to win us the game. They lead the League in hand offs, uh that's their offense. Um, Blake does a great job of, uh, initiating the offense of those guys, so it'll be a challenge to, to, to guard ball handling on the dribble hand off and guard the guy coming off with the dribble hand off. So, uh, I know what person, I know who I'm guarding. It'll help me out a lot. Uh, we know what we supposed to do on our defense so [inaudible]. [inaudible] sixteen straight? Eighteen straight? He's special. We needed it, we needed the spark. Um, like you said I saw a lot of guys he definitely would've been and one of those times where it was special. Uh, to eat up on the road, uh, last game of the road trip for a young guy like himself? That's pretty big, that's pretty special [inaudible] we have. Uh, we did a good job of getting us, getting in the right direction and getting our team in the right direction. Taking the lead there, they had one run in the third quarter that really, uh, had our back against the wall a little bit and uh, he did a great job on the ball. It was special to be a part of. You're welcome. Thank you guys. You're welcome.",3
"A lot of guys are just on the same page. Like I just said, we're all tryna buy into the team. Uh obviously there's a lotta uh lotta different ages on our team so we're just tryna come together as a team [inaudible] uh from each and every game and continue to learn. Uh uh, everybody's tryna learn some of us even more to make us even more daily on the court. We gon take it one game at a time. I don't, we a young team I don't want em to get too excited um obviously we right where we need to be to [inaudible] around the playoffs. We gotta take it one game at a time. We did a good job on the road trip taking one game at a time. Bouncing back from a tough loss in Sacramento and winnin the last two. So, we got a good stretch at home hopefully we take it one game at a time and see where we fall. Well I've been the underdog my whole life so it's kinda I'm in familiar territory here. I've not been a hot draft pick, I'm not not, nothing like that. I just got here from working every day. And I think that our team is taking on that identity. Not not bonding to the hype of the media and uh we just tryna take our own. Uh, obviously we got counted out early as not a playoff team but you gotta play basketball in this league and that's what we been doing and we tryna get better each and every night. Thank you",1
"Well, obviously just tryna give em different looks. Have a lot of different coverages in our back pocket for tonight. Uh, you don't want to give em a steady dose of any coverage obviously you gotta mix it up. These guys do a good job of uh, as a team, gettin into a good offensive rhythm and you just try to break that with as much hard play and different schemes and stuff like that so we have a few ready for tonight. We just play together. All five guys on the court. Uh, being on the same page and playing with force. Uh, gettin down hill. Banging shots with confidence and uh playin with a good tempo I think that's key for us against these guys is playing with a good temp and stand, stand together. I mean I wouldn't say it all clickin. It's just we just put some good games together. But we have a lot of learning to do. Obviously we tryna learn how to win on a consistent basis and that takes time. It takes a lotta effort and uh film watching and just being on the same page like I been preaching but, it has been a a good steady uh dosage of us trying to get better each and every day. And it's paying off with games. It's paying off with the winning but in practices and film sessions, we taking em very serious. And, just tryna get better and it's helping. We definitely have the fight. We definitely have the fight. We gotta continue to build the the character that we want to be. The team that we want to be, but we have the fight and we have the resilience to, to just come out each and every game and compete at a high level and I think that's key. That's, that's the main goal is to just compete at a high level and wherever the chips fall, they fall. But we definitely have that in our back pocket. I'm accepting it. I mean, the locker room, um, uh accepting me being the leader of the team and obviously I'm tryna do whatever I have to do each and every day to to be the leader on and off the court but it's definitely accepted with our group and I appreciate it and I'm just gonna continue to get my best efforts.",1
"Well I just feel like it's a sense of urgency with everything we do. Uh with our practices um and our attention to detail. We got guys locked in right now and it's paying off for wins. Um but we gotta stay the course. Obviously it's gonna be times where we may drop a game but uh we gotta continue to learn from those losses and wins learn from those and watch film and continue to put our best step forward each and every game. Well I just thought was like uh, the the team continuity was obviously a few days we had before camp to come here and how many guys is here before training camp started, that's special in itself. That's very rare in an NBA NBA team to get guys pretty much the whole roster uh in the city two weeks before training camp. That alone has me like I want to be a part of it I'll buy into it obviously it's a challenge with me where I'm at in my career, it's a challenge of playing meaningful basketball. I've been playing in the playoffs the past five years that's what I want to do and obviously uh we've been winning games here and we're in the playoffs right now and I just took on the challenge to try to lead and be accountable for myself and be accountable for my teammate each and every day and it's obviously it's paying off right now. Long season ago you gotta stay the course. No doubt, uh definitely I said I was joking with Tim from um ESPN the other day it's like a being a proud father I'm sure coaches too feel the same way just by seeing the growth from the started of the season till now. It's like we definitely have grown um a lot of games didn't go away earlier but we didn't hang our heads we didn't get too down. Um and we didn't listen to the critics obviously you just kind of put your best foot forward each and every day and if you stay the course, good things tend to happen. I just feel like he had a good player coach relationship. He, he left that door open from the  start with everybody from top to bottom and you have to respect that. He didn't come in here thinking he knew it all. It was his first year, he's opening to hearing new suggestions from us older guys and I think from that point on, um we had a good relationship he had a good relationship with every guy from one to fifteen so that earned the trust of the guys in the locker room for sure. Yeah you can ask those guys. I don't hold back, and I don't want you to hold back with me if I'm BSing on the court or if I'm missing an assignment on the court. I told coach you can hold us accountable and I think with me saying in front of the guys, I have to be number one. I feel like, and I think everybody else will follow suit and that's what's, that's what's taking place right now and I just I want to be held accountable. I want to hold my guys accountable I want a hold uh the coaching staff accountable. That's how you win. That's how you tend to get better. That's how you progress forward you don't really sugarcoat anybody. Um, we all are having the same goal right now and it's pretty fun to be a part of. Yep, yep it's a new test and obviously you can get lackadaisical and not focus in on the opponent and let a lesser team comes beat you, but at the same time you have to taken it one game at a time. That's what I've been preaching. We've been looking at the standings a little bit but really you can't pay attention to that because you uh got to take this thing one game at a time. You can't look forward to opponents and, and dwell on losses. So you gotta continue to put your best foot for each and every day and it is a new challenge with the winning streak and everything. Drawing national attention. Obviously I've been at the highest [inaudible] pedestal before and then, um it takes a lot for a team to continue to hone in and focus on on on the one prize winning, winning the next game. [inaudible]. I've got good relationships all across the board from top to bottom. I'm really in it. I'm really locked in on um our team. Um, but I really can't say what the direction of the organization is but I'm locked in I'm giving my all 100%. I would like to be here, but at the same time, I understand it's a business. I've been a part of this plenty of times and wherever the chips may fall, they fall. No sir. No sir, I don't know anything. Yeah, he's definitely got that part down. He's definitely a floor general as we all know. And um, it just took time with him just getting the pace and learning how to get everybody involved and that [inaudible] assist numbers rack up. It was just taking a game and learning [inaudible] really learning the NBA game cuz this is much different than in the college level. So, I think he's done a good job of watching film and trying to put himself in position to help our team the way we need him to. Um and taking on taking control of controlling the pace and getting everybody involved in getting yourself involved as well. Well you saw him getta tech last game right? I liked it. I a'int gonna lie to you. I loved it. I loved it I and um, I told coach don't get on him don't get on let him, let him, let him be emotional I want to see that because they're showing the fire, the fierce, the competitiveness that's bringing everything out of you and I, I like that I think that's that's what we need I think um he has it in him. Like I said he's a young kid uh raised in a good home but he does have a level of competitive that we haven't saw. And I think we saw a glimpse of it in our last game and I like to [inaudible] obviously. Oh, I just went to a [inaudible] practice. I'm a little sore but I have, really plan on playing tomorrow. I have a different judgment in the morning but as of right now, I plan on playing. I just see a lot of, all five guys on the court on the same page. Once you everybody knowing what we got to do is just give it effort now. I think our effort level that, has risen a little bit and I think our communication with, with each other on the court has grown because you gotta realize we are a young team. So young teams tend to not talk. It's like they're embarrassed to talk or scared to talk but if you know what you're doing you got to talk. You need to talk to help your teammates and I feel like our level of communication has definitely picked up in the past month Oh a hundred percent. He's the most important one to talk. The guards is guarding the ball the biggest guys come and settin' ball screens so whatever coverage we are in we have to all be on the same page. And I think we've done a good job with that the past month. Of just being on the same page and coach doing a good job of uh translating what he want from us and the five guys on the court just gonna say I appreciate all the time. Our guys on the court need to be on the same page. Boston. I think Brad gave me the keys to call plays in Boston along with along with Isiah Thomas we're the two guys calling plays. I feel like my coaching staff know I have a quarterback mentality I used to play quarterback so I'm naturally born like the talk and lead and try to put guys in position. I know every everybody position on the court. When we call the play I know where everybody needs to be I just knowing every every play book I ever played in,I know it. And I think I gained the trust of my coaches. Obviously Brad Stevens was one of the first coach that ever put that put that in me at this level and um coaches coaches definitely helped me I mean relied on me to be that leader on the court and I think it has been beneficial to us because at times Ja may may not know who to, what play to call at the time of the game and so I'm kind of helping with that while I'm on the court and allow him to grow from that and just be a floor general and have, gain the trust of coach Jenkins to call the play if you feel like it. Be confident in it, you know the playbook, you know where everybody needs to be. Call a set. and get everybody in the ball so,  I think I applaud coach Jenkins for giving me the opportunity to lead in that that manner. I am surprised because usually you you hold younger guys on a tighter leash. Uh but he knows what type of guys he has. He has guys that definitely locked in and um willing willing to learn from um their mistakes and he's doing a good job of uh communicating with those guys what he want out of them and once you get that you definitely can unleash the leash a little bit on them let him play freely. And I think as a young guy you don't want to tend to think much on the court at this level cuz you if the other team sees you thinking or hesitating that's when they tend to attack on you. So, it's been a good job with just letting guys play free. Um not trying to cram that brain with too much stuff and let em play free and let em be athletes and play within his system. And it's been it's been great for us.",1
"These guys are big brothers to me, obviously the Marquette guys my big brothers and I joke around with Pat yesterday on the phone and he said Marquette uh hosting hosting [inaudible]. So, um it feels right at home. Everything feels right. I'm happy to be here my family's happy to be here and I'm ready to get the ball goin. Well yeah I was very excited um because these guys are playing well all year long. You see them from a distance, we played with guys first game of the season it just feels like they're having fun with it. They playin are very hard very very competitive group and I just want to put add on to that I'm a competitor. I like that I like to win like to do whatever it takes to win so I'm here to have fun and get some wins. I was just about to say, that the way they prepare prepare for a game. The way coach prepared for a game. And the way he expect his players of to prepare is right at home for me it's nothing different. Obviously I'm locked in, I watch film I do my homework but the way they prepare today uh to take on these guys is the way I look at myself to prepare for a game and I'll fit right at home. I ain't saw it all yet, but I have saw quite a few. And it does a little bit but each team has his own own own thing going on our own chemistry own verbal usage, uh so once week I got to get the hang of that everything else is is basketball at the end of the day and it's the same principles in the NBA uh but just different different terminology uh obviously and I get used to it. I would hope so, yeah I wanna get out there as soon as possible. Obviously um take this game under my belt. Watch these guys, watch practice uh watch the way they prepare and get a practice in before I play and I'll be ready to go.",2
"We're just trying to build one game at a time and I just feel like tonight was a good opportunity to keep it going obviously there's a great team coming in um and top of the conference. So that was a good test for us and we responded well. Provide, that's exactly what I want to do, provide a winning attitude, a winning mindset to the team. Um, give ourselves a chance to play for it all. Obviously uh you know coming into this organization, it's championship or bust, so you know, I want to do everything I can to help my team. Put, put myself in position and my teammates in position to win games on a nightly basis so that's all I was thinking. Uh it just says that he believes in what I bring to the team I guess. And um obviously I just, I want to go down as a winner. When I leave this league I wanna go down as a winner. A guy who makes winning plays on both ends of the court and I just feel like that's the [inaudible] I bring to this team. And um whenever I'm on the court, I just want to do what I can to help my teammates win the game. I do whatever it take. And I cheer em on if I'm off the court. [inaudible], winning rebound, hit the winning shot, I do whatever it takes to win a game. Well,  I'm not I'm not thinking as much as I was the first week I got here, I can tell you that much. Obviously I still have a long way to go with learning some some things but competing is something I bring to each team I go to. So that makes it a lot easier for me to catch on very fast and just compete at a high level and obviously get terminology and play calls as the game goes. And as time flies. Well, we set the bar high for ourselves I can tell you that much it's a collective effort tonight all five guys on the court was definitely given um assignment to help one another and we did that tonight and was able to hold a great scoring off with the team - which is like thirteen points or whatever underneath the average so it just tells us how connected we were on that in the court as a unit.",2
"Uh, I feel good. I felt like I made strides in the areas that I wanted to work on. Obviously, it's not completely there but I'm not with the partners that I made and I'm the going to continue working. Definitely a good start. My first time playing, uh, against NBA competition in a while. I played every now and then with five on five during practice but, uh, I'll probably go out and play. Good, I feel good. Um, got winded earlier on back on my second one for the first few minutes but other than that I'm happy, uh, with my conditioning, I'm happy with my me, I'm happy with with myself so. I think it's really important. Especially with me losing fifteen pounds and me haven't played, uh, in a while. So I'm happy that we have four more of these and here in my rhythm in off-season, I can earn, earn this spot on this team. Uh, find myself somewhere in the rotation so I'm work as hard as I can and earn whatever I can. Uh, I think that's a huge part of it. Um, I think the drastic changes has really benefited me. Um, you know losing fifteen or twenty pounds has helped and then on top of that with just being healthy. I don't have to think about my knee. There's no swelling in my knee so I think with me losing weight and as well as me taking care of my knee it's really benefiting out there so I'm happy to say that.",2
"Say it again. Uh, I was fine with that. Uh, I didn't honestly, I didn't want them to pick up my option. Um, I been going through a lot since I've been here so, the fact that I know that at the end of the season that I will at least have the opportunity to play else where, that feels great. Um, I was in the position to where, how can I get on the court. And that's not happening here. And, um, I want to play. I want to play. Um, Coach Bryan knows that. I've talked to him about it. That was tough if my option isn't picked up, uh, a team not really looking to give up anything [inaudible] someone can walk out the door at the end of the season. So puts me in a tough spot because I want to be on the court. Um, which is my life, which is my career, and I'm not getting the opportunity here. Uh, which is fine. The team looks great and if I'm not a part of that then, [inaudible] to do great things, but at the same time, I want to play.",0
"Uh, my agent called me uh before, an hour before it came up obviously I think via Twitter, but my agent gave me a call, let me know that these other trader are about to happen so I froze I was excited. I let my family know, we're just all excited and eager to get down there. I mean it means a lot to me. I really wanted a change of scenery and the fact that it's here in Brooklyn, it doesn't get much better than that so I'm excited and I can't wait to get started. Uh, a bunch of stuff happened and I'm happy that I went through. The first thing was the injury. Um, I got hurt and then never really got healthy kind of rushed back just because of the all the players we had in my position. Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, so, I kind of jumped back on to the court sooner than I should have just because I wanted to make sure that solidify my spot. So, I think the injury was the biggest thing they never really recovered so I, I miss last year as well because of the knee. Um, there's been a lot of communications. All the guys are [inaudible] and all eager and hungry as well. Uh, like I knew D'Angelo already and I knew Rhonda, so, I was really close with those guys. So, they've been helping me and I'm just meeting the new guys on the team, or new to me. Uh, I think everybody know I'm a scorer. Uh, I can score, that's what I do. Put the ball in the bucket and then just another young guy who is hungry and ready to learn. Uh, I'm trying to learn everything that the way they play on how they play really fast. So, I'm trying to catch up to that, learn their plays, learn the new system, uh, but it's all, it's all good. Uh yeah, I think I'm right after writing with that in that regard I have a chip in my shoulder. I think you'd noticed that. I've always been considered that guy. This is the first time where people are doubting me and people are kind of against me so that's good. I'm happy I'm not experiencing it, but I'm ready to go out there and prove what I can do.",2
"Um, it was amazing just to finally be out there. Um, felt rusty [inaudible] some cobwebs on me, but just to be able to be out there, go up and down and play basketball was great. So, obviously it was a tough one for all of us tonight but for me personally just to finally be on the court after not playing for so long, it was a, it was good. I don't think I've ever really found the rhythm. Um, just haven't played in a while but I wouldn't  really say I found the rhythm. But just the, the feelings you get before a game I haven't had that in a while. You know, like the jitters and the nerves that you get. Uh, I personally didn't have that in awhile because I felt like I wasn't gonna play so I was really just chillin before the game. So to finally actually having that focus and feel that again, it was great. Uh, sooner than later. It shouldn't take me too long. Today was the first day to get out there and Imma figure it out I'm figure out really soon but just to finally be out there, uh be a part of this team and hopefully I can improve I got the standard [inaudible]. Yeah,  everybody in the league knows if you can as much target as you want but, uh, the NBA game is completely different. You can run as much as you want on the treadmill, but once you get in the game you're bumping there's big bodies and defending running up and down it's completely different so, the wind is definitely something that I need to get better at and that's just going to happen with just playing more games. Say that again? Uh, it's huge. It's huge. I know those minutes are something that Imma have to earn but to have this opportunity, uh, is great. Um, and I was just, think I need to get where I need to work on to get better. But you're just playing and and getting my cardio better, and just get in the rhythm of playing an NBA game again. It's something I'm looking forward to. I think there's a lot that goes into that. Uh, the first thing is, is it back to back. The second night of a back to back is always tough. Uh, just coming in late last night I don't have an issues bother guys they played a match after they were all tired. And credit to Toronto. They were hitting shots. Kyle Lowry was hitting shots, Demar DeRozan was phenomenal in that second quarter. So, I, um, corrected them but also there's obviously things that we'll watch them more cuz we know we can get better. I'm excited, man. I'm so excited. I'm happy that I was able to come out at first and kind of, uh, test the waters and get some of the webs off so I try to perform better in front of our home crowd, but I can't wait to play in Barclays.",2
"No I just like play games, that's all I like. You know - you know it was - it was kind of frustrating, but you know I never - I never give up,  I never I never stopped playing, you know, wait for my chance I got a chance and I kept playing. We played - we played pretty good defense you know. We played uh, five guys defense, so you know, one guys goes - goes down, next one steps up and we helped each other, we - we you know, we've been -  we've been on the strings you know we've been on the chain - chain reaction so that - that's - that - that's great, that's - that's what our identity should be. It felt good. It felt good, um, you know I'm just doing my job, you know, if he - if coach feels it like that, that's extra motivation for me.",1
"Really boring no competition. Uh, I mean working hard I maintain my own conditioning but it's not the same you know playing a game. You know you want that competition you want that matchups you want that [inaudible] you know so that's so that's what you miss the most - I am me personally You know I'm trying to put myself in the game and see what I can do better or what I can do or what I need to do better when I come back you know. I'm trying to simulate myself playing a game so um you know not much you can do right now about about again you know just watch and learn and and try to try to stay staying tuned and and be ready to come back. Yeah you know we talk it's kind of. When you playing you don't see yourself you know. Sometimes you sometimes you do uh you think you do a uh good job but you don't, so talking between bigs it's you know it's helpful. I mean every injure injury is bad you know you go through - similar stuff you know you're not playing you sit. Good thing is it's hand injuries upper body injury so so I can maintain my uh running conditioning and you know be able to do something so you know trying to find something positive out of that you know. - Taken off, yeah . Yeah, I had uh a splint, I was like in like week in a half in an actual cast and then they made a splint um - you know a smaller one. So finally I can take it out. Yeah, I mean  during the normal life yeah and during the practices or some kind of activities where is the emergency uh I mean danger to get hit or something like that I have to wear a cast uh cast yeah. Uh - feels good feels good to be to be out of that thing. No, stitches run out. I mean - if you don't do anything doesn't hurt, yeah. Oh that's - that's that's up to League and up to the uh uh - doctors you know where they can come up with it so we'll see. It's not it's not my decision to make. When that happened yeah, but after the surgery a couple days pain pain went away and, you know, it was like completely surrounded by uh a cast so it's not moving at all so it's not painful at all. I mean it was surgery you know it's not like - I disclocated and you can pop back in.",0
Good to be part of the team you know. Yeah it's not fun sitting on the sidelines you know it's not fun uh just running with Johnny Lee I'm not saying he's bad guy he's uh a strength conditioning coach of the year you know but uh it's it's not fun just doing something without competition numbers competition. Yeah it's day-by-day you know it's I don't know what to say you know day by day we will see and uh probably in no time I'm gonna be back Yeah actually today I got hit I'm still still here I'm not out so it's pretty good We'll see we'll see tomorrow You know my main my main thing is setting the good screens and getting guys open and that's what I'm going to try to do you know we're gonna got a share ball we got a play together we got to get some get some structure where we play on offense you know on defense you know protecting the rim that's the biggest biggest goal protect the rim protect the paint and uh be successful Yeah that's that's my job you know to get in guys open it's going to be not saying the Serg ir Greg doesn't do a good job but you know my specific my job is to free the shooters you know set a good ball screens set a good pick-and-roll that's that's my thing You should ask my hand I mean yeah it's uh you know it's still it's still a little sore and then you know pain is not a problem but you know being hundred percent sure it's not going to happen again and finding the right typing job finding the right word I can play with with the uh with the tape and feel the ball and you know some some tape some taping jobs are restricting from from having a good grip on the ball so you know it's how I feel comfortable I need to I need to get a couple practice in me you know I can't just go out there and play and it's gonna be soon,1
"Nice to meet you guys. Yeah,logistically it was uh kind of crazy,you know. I wasn't expected so, you know, getting getting all my stuff and getting somewhere else it was uh - it was a uh - hard but finally I'm here and I'm ready you know I have my first workout and there you go I'm here.

Stack yeah, I know Stack since he was in Toronto so you know I just got got in last night but I had uh a chance to chat with him this morning and you know very high expectation.",2
"Uh, I mean down the stretch we played good. I mean, you know, we executed we made we made some mistakes on defense, but but still we were playing solid basketball in the first quarter. Second quarter, that's where that's where it got us in trouble, so- you know we gotta we gotta clean those those those starts you know the first quarter especially. You know we gave up the thirty seven points we we we can't, you know, I'm starting lineup, from me protecting the paint and,you know, we gotta we gotta do a better job on that one. As a team sport, you know, we uh try to win the game. You know, we trying to build good habits. Try to, you know, learn how to win the game you know you know. Stats are stats, you know, we don't look at the stats, we look at the uh result. I mean I'm enjoying it. As long as - it's productive I'm enjoying it. We, as I said a couple seconds ago,we're trying to win a game we do anything what uh coach thinks is the best, you know, I'm about I'm about winning. Losing sucks anything that helps us winning will do it.",0
Yeah I know him from day one ya know he added so many things in his game you know he's his finishes around the basket being been terrific you know he's he's good driving the ball towards the basket and you know pushing you know he's improved a lot Yeah you know it's not like giving a hard time you know we're trying to try to teach the young guy to how to become a better player you know how to become how to uh become one of the elite players you know he has a great body for the for a basketball uh if you want to create a basketball player probably that's that's him body wise and you know he just he's working hard he added the shots he added a lot of stuff in his game and I know he's just getting better so future's in front of him You know as I said before like he added so many so many stuff in his game and I'm happy you know he's my teammate he's great defensively long ass arms so he's great You know those days like this practicing wise he's great for us work we've gotta add some small details you know trying to shape up some things defensively offensively and you know we we going on a road trip with the good confidence you know we've gone there to win the game give us give give our the best shot,2
"The rim like me, that's it. Nah it went in. My teammates get me open. Uh, I'm just making shots. Uh, just knowing that, you know everybody kind of, you know, we kind of banged up you know. We didn't have all our, you know main guys and stuff. So you know I had to step up and, uh, I knew what I to do tonight. Nah, nah, I'm just talking to someone. Yeah, um, you know, just playing. You know, I didn't have. I was just hoping today. Uh, just comfortable and not thinking too much. Um, and that's it. Yeah. Nah. Alright, Zo. Uh, nah, I just came in just trying to hoop, trying to win. You know, uh we lost that game in Memphis. I was trying to get back, get back to uh, get back on our feet. Uh, I just knew we, we had to do something. Uh, cuz everybody, you know, we missing. No KCP, Brandon, Zo, we just kind of just everybody just kind of have to do their job and step up. Uh, it's cool. Big thing is, you know, just getting a win for us. Um, but you know for me it was you know getting back to the basics, getting back in the gym. You know I had, uh, a little struggle month I feel like. Uh, with my shooting and stuff, but you know hopefully this, uh, turnaround for me this month. Yeah. Um, I feel like I you know was speeding up a little bit. It's nice to slow it down. Um, I just got back to the basics. Close the floor. You know we knew they was gonna run a lot through Victor so, um, we just closed the floor and try to force turnovers and get out in transition. Who from the three? Okay. Oh, they just, psh. I don't know. Maybe they gotta get some work in too. But shoot, we gotta get some work in too, man. That free throw line, it's like a virus or something, man. That joint. I don't know, what did we shoot, twenty two from the free throw line? [inaudible] Oh shit, oh my bad. Yo, uh. Oh, for real? Dang, that's crazy. Yeah, we, yeah, yeah we gotta fix that. You know, we gotta get in the gym. I don't know. I don't have Instagram on my phone. They locked me out. Yo, uh, yeah, man, Instagram holla at me, yo. I can't get in my account. Uh, I'm locked out so. I'm locked out, man. Uh, nah I'm just hooping. You know, to be honest with you, uh if I'm here you want me to help, to help them win games. Uh, impact how I can. You know, if I'm not, it is what it is. You know, Imma, yeah, go ahead. Psh whenever it was going in. I mean, when it was going in. My bad! When the shots was just falling. Uh, you know, Luke drew up a play for me, a cut in the back door, he got me going early with a lay up. Uh, dang I'm about to get in trouble, I'll holla at y'all some other time.",2
"Had the game, you know, just slow it down. Got back to the basics, did my job. Um, just knowing when I'll get going or they gonna try to trap me on the screens. Uh, throw two, two guys on me, breaking the defense open. Just finding the next man. Uh, yeah I think coach we said after the game that he called the timeout like seven minutes and uh, they only scored five points after that in the third quarter, so. [inaudible] I had on the defense end, got out on transition, made easy buckets. Just, defensive stops. Um, that was it. Um, you know he's from Texas. I'm from Texas. You know what I'm saying. You know how he do. Um, but nah I mean, I've been watching AC play. I play AC in college, I played against him in college. You know, kind of, kind of grew up around the AAU scene. We, like our junior high school. Um, kind of just knowing what he do and uh, you know it was just kind of just coming together with us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's good. I used to hate playing against AC in college. Uh, one of them, uh, pesky dudes getting in you defensively. Um, get people involved. Um, you know it's good we got him on the squad. Nah, I feel like I kind of had the same mindset, you know, off jump. Uh, just getting more time on the court, uh, finding plays anything to slow them down.",2
"Yeah, that's what's crazy. But um, we, you know, finished the game out. Got a win. KC made a big stop. You know everybody gonna get free throws, but uh, he made a big stop on Marcus that forced him into a tough shot at the end of a game. So, he made it up on that end. Yeah, um, we got stops. I feel like we was playing well defensively. Um, I mean we just made shots in the second half. Big, uh. Big plays, big shots. Um, it's good to see that [inaudible]. Just give him the ball. Yeah, you know, he had Al Horford on him. Uh, you know he can move a little bit so you know he just caused some trouble for him. Uh, make 'em. That's it. Focus and make 'em. That's all we could do. I was going to say something crazy but, uh, you know what, I was just, I was just [inaudible] in. Uh, just focus on the rim, that's all I see.",3
"Uh, I mean it's a different style, you know. They push the ball as well. So, it's getting out, um, running the lanes, uh I'm just coming, impact the game anyway I can. That's, uh, the biggest thing. Uh, I haven't really heard much yet. Um, just coming in here with an open mind. Um, we'll see tomorrow. Um, sometimes you know we're out playing and stuff like that. So, uh, you know I'm ready for whatever. Yeah, definitely make, you know, first trade, um. First time I've been traded in the league. Um, definitely good to have somebody that you know that I've been with for like, three years, uh, with me. Um, I mean it's kind of, of relieving you know. Uh, being able to be in a place they want you here, uh, coming here to compete. Uh, you know all the rumors and stuff, uh, you know sometimes a tough message to hear during the year, but you know I'm just happy to be here and uh, feel like it's a blessing. Uh, I was asleep on the couch to be honest with you. You know, Magic, Rob, uh, you know, they called me like three times. I was sleep on the couch, uh, I just kind of looked at the phone cuz we had a game. It was shoot around and I was like, man I'm gonna get my sleep real quick. Then, I called them like fifteen minutes later and then you know I had to move. Yeah, I know what, uh, I know what their main goal is. You know it's to bring a chip here so, um, coming in here with definitely different mindset, uh, coming in trying to win. Uh, I know everytime I step on the floor, uh, we got, we got a chance to win. You know, in Los Angeles, I feel like we was working to build something. Here, it's, you know we here to, you know, win, compete, and uh, try to get to uh, try to get the chip. I did, you know, that was pretty crazy. And that's kinda something I'm always gonna be able to tell my kids. Um, [inaudible] you know what it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I did. Yeah, yeah, um, him and Kobe are definitely two players that I watched growing up. Um, you know to play alongside him, it was pretty crazy. Something that Imma cherish a lot. Uh, yeah. Feel like that's my job. You know, come in there, [inaudible], coming in there, score, make plays, uh, play defense. Yeah I mean, um, just times of us going through the plays, uh, shoot he already knew like what I like to do, basically. Um, so he kind of just threw me in a position as well as, uh, as well as coach. So, um, I feel like I'm real comfortable here right now. Um, I mean him and Kobe is, uh, probably the most detailed and I feel like that's why they the best players. You know, arguably just two best players, to, you know, play. So, you know, they real detailed, feel like my rookie year. They knew everything about me so, um, you know I have another player like that. It's definitely cool to play with.",2
"Today, uh, but I feel like you know, we keep playing like that, having fun, moving the ball. Uh, things would come a lot faster for us. It's a way to hoop. It's a, it's a way to hoop. That's it. Um, you know you're out there on the floor for a purpose. Uh, you know we're out there to win. You know, just uh, you know he got, I knew he got one goal you want to win that chip. So, we just here to help and um, you know, do our job. We had a game. I think we was playing, uh, well when I was with the Lakers, I was getting ready to play the, to play the Thunder. Um, we had shoot around, I was sleep, Magic and Rob they was calling. Uh, I kind of like push, push the phone to the side a little bit, try to get some more rest before the game and, uh, I called him back like ten, fifteen minutes later and they just told me, uh, you know, I got traded. Um and that was it. Um, I was excited. You know, but at the same time it's kind of like, it's my first time being traded. Uh, coming somewhere where I really don't know nobody. Um, but it's easy having Larry here with me. Uh, guy that I played with. Uh, but these guys, you know, they welcomed us with open arms. You know, even, uh, when we landed, some hours that we spent before this game, you know, you say, see that dudes really care and uh, you know it's cool. It's a cool vibe. You say what? Yeah, uh, especially without no practice. Uh nothin' crazy so, um, a lot of it was all communication. We did a good job communicating and uh, helping each other, having each other's back moving, flying around the court. I think it was awesome.",3
"Uh, just feeling good. You know we still got a long way to go. We, uh, know be in for a couple of days now so we're just gonna keep continue, uh, working. Uh, you know focusing on one thing. Let's win. Uh, it's fun man. Courts are open. Um, everybody playing for each other, uh, no matter who score the ball, um, me getting in the paint, making a plays for each other. You know, it's fun basketball. That's how you supposed to play. Yeah. You know, Larry crash the glass hard. He rolls hard, he makes big plays and, um, you know that's what he, I seen in LA. And he doing it out here. So it's definitely a good thing. Uh, for me, I didn't really have none. I know that they, they, they here to win games. You know, I'm coming, I'm coming in here, um, trying to figure out my part is. Play my part. Help them win. Impact the game when I'm on the floor. And uh, that's it. Yeah, uh, well, I mean, Ty told me to come in here, be aggressive, and do what I do. So, uh, you know, that's what, that's, uh, how you fit in. Being yourself. Everybody talk and communicating. You know we aggressive on the ball. Uh, know rotations as well. You know we make me second or third efforts. You know, we still don't, uh, got along, but it going in on that end too. So you know we're just gonna keep getting better at communicating. Uh, just keep getting better everywhere.",3
"Um, we made shots, we move the ball, we got stops defensively, um, we just did a good job of converting on the offense and you know Kevin had a big game after he scored 19 or 20 something off like four attempts, so he was doing a good job today and getting fouled and getting to the line. Tristan had a big game as well, so offensively was moving the ball they put a lot of pressure on the rim so we always getting open shots from the perimeter. Um, I mean it's easy to get the game going from the outside when you start in so, um, they had a good two-man game going, you saw them rolling and, uh, Kevin make it past the Tristan roll into the basket and vice versa so makes the game easier for us because they're putting so much pressure on the rim helps us get wide open shots on the outside. Uh, yeah well actually the last two games nothing to play defense really well. We have teams to good field goal percentage and you know he's running off three-point line we had that stretch where I said they was gonna have a run, um, you know we slowed it down and uh then came back and put it on them but, um, I think our defense is growing so much. John-Blair Bickerstaff is doing a good job of really, um, nailing it down and you know talking about our communication everything like that, uh, so he's doing a great job implementing all that with us. Uh, Kevin probably. But yeah it was dope it's his first career win, uh, yeah it's cool. Uh, We was Uh just doing the same thing get in the paint, kick it out, find shooters, um and then keep continue to play to the other side. If we ain't got nothing on this side bring it to the other side and keep moving. We just can't stand still and watch guys kind of ice people up so as long as they keep moving the ball is gonna move as well it's gonna make everything easier. Hah, yeah yeah, I came here pretty hyped at halftime. I thought he had two of them I kicked him the second one I thought he's gonna make that second one but uh he's been practicing over the summer I seen him uh doing that so it's good to see him knock his first one in.",3
"We just continue to play hard, um, you know we never out the game. You know we got down ten, uh, at one point and kept pulling the game and close and then you know even [inaudible] took the lead at one time. We just kept fighting. A lot of us started on our defense, um, communicating well right now, um, just a few things at the end we just needed a tweak, um, we got a good, no good, uh, looks to us in the game it was a great shot thought it was going in too, by Kevin and you know we just right there, we fighting. Um, just our communication. A lot of us are getting comfortable with each other, um, being able to communicate on the floor you know Tristan has kind of been our, uh, like anchor on the defense and communicating back there, um, you know blocking shots, uh, walling guys up as well so, uh, us guards, um, you know really contesting. We're navigating, um, those screens, um, you know just trying to force them off they spots but you know they've done a good job. John-Blair Bickerstaff as well putting a lot of stuff here so they are doing a really good job. Uh just trying to impact the game any way I can. Try to play defense as well, um, and um, you know make make plays, too. I just got to keep continue to grind and, um, you know keep progressing because, um, today you know it's, it's not, it's not gonna be about tonight, it's gonna be about later on down the road. Uh, if we keep continue to play how we playing, the mistakes you made tonight, you know, help us in the long run. I was just being aggressive, um, about the same time trying to play slow, uh, especially in the paint, um, you know just feel the defense out you know when I have opportunity to uh, you know score, uh, put the ball in the basket, I try to. Um, I mean usually you know during those times that anything happens. Uh, I think we had the lead at that time, trying to get good, uh, good shots as well. Run some clock so you know we got some good looks, um, some didn't go in and you know we just gotta live with that.",2
"Um, just, everybody just kind of getting me open. Screening [inaudible] you know, consistently moving. We're moving the ball pretty well tonight so, uh, caused a lot of open shots. It was really good for us. That's the best, you know. He teams have, uh, have been putting pressure on the rim on us all year. You know him being down there it really changes the game. You know his seven blocks are probably more than anything else tonight just because we was getting those extra other possessions and you know who's been burning on those plays too. Uh I mean it's good. You know we play fast, uh, you know he has been on the floor as well uh you know when he when he's in there, he, he's able to kick the ball out, he knows I could create as well too. Uh you know he's doing a good job you know running that unit with us. [Laughs] Oh, I said I was like ""damn."" He was in the air forever. I was like ""Oh my god."" I know. That was crazy. Now I seen the replay when we came back here after the game, I thought Kevin was done for. I was like, ""Yo, you about to be everywhere tomorrow."" Yeah I think that probably would have been the best dunk in game. Seriously. Yeah, that's crazy.",3
"Um, you know they're doing amazing things. It's a great team, it's a great group of guys they got together. Everybody's playing and uh for each other. Um nothing against Cleveland or nothing. But I'm just happy for the opportunity here, uh, to go out here and try to help the organization achieve some of their goals. Uh, yeah I was running out getting ready to go on the court. Got pulled off to the side said I was traded, uh, flew home for Christmas I got to spend it with my family and then just locked in and got in today and just was, uh, ready to go. Just as many swing, swing passes you know. It's a lot of hockey assists, um, going on. Uh and then, you know, big plays by Donovan, Joe and big fella. Rudy man, he's. Those are special guys. I'm definitely, definitely, um, something you know nice to be apart of. Well, I just came here really with an open mind. I know these guys are really good. They got a talented group of guys. Um, like I said, just coming here with an open mind. Um, just helping in any way I can. Um, and just lay it out on the line when I'm out there. You say, what? Um, you know, he puts guys in a lot of good positions. You know, he runs a lot of screen and rolls. Lets guys get downhill, um, they spread the floor awesome so, just going in there, trying to learn, um, what all he's putting in. It's definitely gonna be a challenge but I'm ready to pick it up and ready to jump right in. Um, just whatever I can. When I'm in there, um, just trying to help any opportunity I get. That's scoring the ball defensively, rebounding, um, just coming out there and try to play with a purpose. Um, and that's really it. Just try to help the organization and their goals. Um, I mean, it's a lot of strength that I have in my game right now. Um, definitely continue to work, um, on everything but I feel like once I figure out the system and the sets, I'll figure out, you know, where I can impact the team. Like I said, it's a great organization. Um, just, you know, trying to embrace this opportunity and uh just helping any way I can and I think uh I'm in a good place and Imma go out there and play hard. Try to get us some wins.",2
"Yeah, yeah. I saw him walking over here with it. Uh, it feels good. My teammates man they were fine to me. They were screening, giving me the ball like how we supposed to do, what we preach. I mean defensively we just did a great job, uh, keeping guys in front of Rudy was being the presence that he is down there. Everybody just pitched in and another great, great team win. Uh, really was we just tried to keep it on the defensive end. We're gonna make shots in the second half, uh, I just kept playing you know. Kept getting stopped so we started getting stuff in transition and made the game easy for us. Oh, it means a lot but like I said, uh, I'm taking one day at a time, continue to progress, keep trying to get everything down um you know I've only been here for three days, four days now so I'm still trying to learn and get a get a feel for this and uh I'm just happy everybody's welcomed me with open arms and uh oh we've got the best fans man in the league hands down.",3
"Honest, just getting open. Uh, just shoot an open shot. When I got space, uh, coach is just tell me to let it go so I'm just trying to do what I can do to impact the game. Uh, we was down by a bunch of them. Eighteen to twenty so, uh, I was just trying to put us in a game where we had a shot at winning. Uh Nah, I'm just [inaudible], as you were saying, just trying to get us back in the game, for real. Trying to stay aggressive, um, keep taking all the shots, uh, trying just to play a little off I was kind of trying to read the defense as well. Get to my angles and make some space, see if I could make a play, so, uh, yeah, get that, get that opportunity to win the game. Towards the end, cutting it close I saw them react, especially on the [inaudible] as a team. Uh, you just gotta push through it and you know, it all depends the rest of the game. You just gotta keep going and get the next one.",1
"Um, we know our second unit is huge for us. Uh, we know the big impact we can do. Uh, however you have to be a high level every time we all know we're gonna make shots or not. We just have to defend, uh, have fun and play with energy. That's our identity and that's what we're trying to do every single night. Yeah, you know when you know that some shots for everybody is easy is easy for the point guard to pass you the ball. Is easy for formational [inaudible] go to the basket. Uh, open a lot of space we just keep going on second quarter and right now we just have to be looking for tomorrow. Um, no, but um, I don't think so. With somedays are like this, somedays are, um, you don't make shots. We don't have to keep believing us. Keep playing with energy and run. Malik is a great player. He's an energetic player. I mean here I've been with him four years. Uh, we've been playing together when he came um through a lot of things. Uh, he's aggressive he's aggressive, he opens all the things he shoot the ball extremely well so he opens things for [inaudible] information so it's it's really fun to play with him. But that's the great thing you know of us; all of us we can play. I told him, um, right be for the unit, Mike reported you know he they are great players they are not just in rotation right now but you know how fast they can change everything they just have to be stay ready there are great players they can play uh, basketball in a really high level and you see Malik got six points in two minutes so um you know sometimes he's tough we are deep team we got to keep through that. Looking we are in a business trip so let's go to Boston and get the win. Um, I mean most a great team they defend really well. They got talented players but we have to do our game we had to play how we play and get the win.",2
"Uh, I would always compete. Uh, be a family. Um, you know, know each other better. I think that our goal to compete every single game and be us. Uh, enjoy enjoy the journey. Um, yes play hard, um, and enjoy. That's it. Sure, um, probably from the first game we see something special mean with with without Karl now is gonna be a little bit more harder but but when he's back I think is gonna be sure. we got really good talented young guys we got to kind of all the stars and it's gonna be easy for us. Uh, it's fun. Uh, it's a chance for me to work on my life so I just try to enjoy, play hard, and win. At that point that game motivates for us for the next season of the Denver player. We we finished the season second place on the west, on the top west so it was a motivation for us. It was a tough, hurt loss but after that moment we we go to a game working really really hard that summer and be ready next season to go like no more no more playing around just for the first game. I think that's like Malik and me have been through that so that's a point for for a start next season without that way you know like every game [inaudible], uh, every loss game like you know like last game for example, we we cannot lose the games like that. Up 16 at the half time. So we gotta learn for that and figure it out. Yeah, uh, I think when you got your minutes and you got your minute's up, your motivation is going to be really high,  higher. You know I didn't have that chance in Denver, um, I just want to keep going, practicing to get my shot up and I'll keep believing in me. No, I mean it's just this this year. My third year I started like 25 minutes a game, we win a lot I play really, really, really, good then I, I came to a summer you know we won the World Championship with me starting on the team in Spain I play really really good last summer and it's just that, that this decision I had a lot to change. But I'm not regretting that. Uh, they have a lot of good players we are we were really really deep team and I didn't have a chance. So, I just found myself, the team let me go and uh, I'm thankful for what they did and I'm thankful for the chance I got right now uh and I just want to play hard and have fun.",2
"Uh, like a weird feeling. You know it was my home for four years, I grew up here, um, I'm the man, like I'm the man who I am because Denver because all organization all the teammates all the coaches. Um, the way the way all all happening like like really fast uh I kind of I kind of sad because I had a chance to say goodbye to everybody and say by the way say what I, I want to say right now I got a change right here so I I just want to thank thanks to everybody from make the day my dream come true make make the change to a kid who was dreaming about NBA, make believe it and make make it true. So thanks first of all, first of all to like [inaudible] family, um for team, [inaudible], to Russ and coach Malone to to make my dream come true. Um, to tell all the kids like the dreams are becoming true if you pursued and you consistent were really hard so I, so I guess I just have a lot of words about thanking to everybody like um, tell me to grow up as a man and as a person who I am hunting am a better person and better player uh when doesn't done when I came so that's that's all all thank you for the [inaudible] and of course the Denver's fans they always cheese for me um even even the hard times they cheer for me when I when I sub in or I started that was like unconditional love for me for all the Denver nation and and I feel I love, I love them and I love all of them all the fans to all the people on the [inaudible]. Uh, it's really difficult I'm not gonna lie it was a hard times this was my home um my theme when the players get out of the comfort zone they are when they work harder and they when they fight for the chance I know I I was really happy here with all the players but I think this chance and this opportunity for me as a player is the best for me. Um, I talked to Joker a couple weeks before the trade like he's my best friend he want them the best things for me so I know he gonna be sad but everything he seen me playing 35 minutes or starting on scoring he's gonna be happy for me because he know how how much I work how much I hurt every time on the team and then and I think he he know I deserve this change so for sure it's tough times but a tough decision at the end are good for for the person. He's a good challenge, I love, I love the challenge the challenge one big challenge when I came to the NBA was come here I'm very nice or come here and competing and be the best player. I love the challenge. Uh, in my life I start, I think I'm gonna get bored. I want a challenge every year. Um, I was thinking about the game but I think it's gonna be more like when Spain play Serbia when I face Joker it was really weird feeling. I wanna cheer for him but at the end I wanna beat him and then that game he got ejected I was I tried to stop him but I'm playing for my country. So, I think it's gonna be there's gonna be a lot of feelings I just want to play hard, enjoy, play for my team and try to get the win. Yeah, just the opportunity. The confidence, um, um, Denver got good players now. Um,  my third year I play a lot and this year I didn't have a chance but I don't blame anyone, I don't blame the coach you know because the coach makes the tough decision to put every player in every moment so I don't blame. It's his work. Um, my love from my coach Malone, man. He, he told me before I, I get trade he told me like he want me to get trade to get the chance because he cared about me so, um, that's the thing. Yeah for sure, I'm excited to see everybody. Um, I already know it. Uh, before the game, that we play, uh, coach talked to me he told me like go to his office I go to him and he told me like he don't want me to play because if I get hurt I don't get the chance to get traded or something like that I told him the best way to me to get off Denver is to fight for a win and I play good, I play great, and we get the win so it was it was for me like the great goodbye you know I already know the trade is gonna be soon but I don't know that soon and I knew you were my, my last my last game ended so I I just enjoyed it, we get the win so that's the best the best way to say goodbye. Tell him like I want to play. It's my decision I'm ready to play I'm ready for the team. He talked to Tim Connelly, you know Tim Connelly love me a lot and I love him so much so he know he know how hard for me is like no play. I wanna play every time even if I heard I play even if I got bad days I play so he know as a competitor was the way the best way to for me so he let me play.",2
"I mean we know we know what goal is to build a chemistry to build a team and if you win that help the chemistry help the guys. Is a good moment especially the way with how we won last game it was it was great. We were down twelve, four minutes left and we keep believing and I think there's a huge huge [inaudible] for us. Yeah, I mean that's the goal, that's the plan. Um, that's a reason we watch film yesterday to try to to get that defense for for 48 minutes and we're gonna be good. Uh, yeah it's huge. Spending time together, spending every day together that that's going to help. Especially in the road we're kind of alone we can we can enjoy an approach that to know each other so I think that's really important to know each other on and off the court. Um see what the people are like on and off the court and just build a relationship. We are building a family that's knowing each other and what we like knowing what like, what we don't like and just just trust each other. That's huge you know. Not just in Miami, he's a [inaudible], a leader, he's the guy we have to focus on. Looking, look at what he does. I mean, he's been around for for like 10 12 14 years he's he's huge. Everytime he talk everybody listen. He know what he been through, he know what we need, and we just follow his leadership. Uh, I like to play against all the good players. It's going to be a hard challenge. He has uh, what's really I know him what he does and what doesn't get to him. Um, he's a leadership. He know, sometimes he know when he wanna be hard on you - just you wake up on the game or what you, or what he want you to expect. Um, you have to be around him to know how big he is. Like, uh, off the court and on the court. Like he know everything. He been through everything bad things [inaudible] things, on the court on the back on the glove things and bad things or good things about teams you know what we need to win. He, he, he know when we have to focus when we had to lock in. Um, yes he's our leader.",3
"Um, we absorb some big runs from them and gotta give them credit. They kept, you know you know they kept coming so uh, I mean and Dan was special it's my first time seeing it you know on his side and it was special to watch and kept getting stops down the stretch and you know the game plan really came to fruition there for us late. Yeah, uh, you know, it's good to see the ball go in but um that'll come. Um, you know as you're finding rhythm as you know kind of get used to things, get the jitters out, and um you know my defense is gonna be the constant thing for me regardless at the shots falling or not so, uh, I just want to find other ways and impact the game you got you know two of the best scorers at their position in the league and Hassan down low and uh, Antsimons did a great job for us off the bench so my job is to go out there and disrupt. Oh yeah, um, my favorite play the game go chase down block um he didn't really hit me hard enough so I just kind of stayed on his hip and I think he jumped off his uh jumped out the wrong foot and I was able to get it, get a good clean block. Easily. Chased down block. Tayshaun Prince and Reggie Miller, uh, LeBron James, Andre Iguodala. You know it changes the game uh and you know got a really good look out of it and those are the plays that really get everyone amped up. That he's on our team. He's a big guy. He had all that big in foul trouble tonight every three or four guys were able to get to the rim, um, knocked down a lot of his free throws and you know did the thing he was put on this planet to do and that's uh you know be a dominant force out there and he helped us out a lot tonight. It's work in progress but you know that's, that's when you got a regular season for. We, we, you know, we trying to you know trying different things we install some new things defensively and you got a lot of new guys so we're still trying to figure it out. But um the efforts there uh and we're finding ways to keep ourselves in a game with that being our, uh, you know deficiency right now I think. Uh, you look at everything else I think we've done a pretty solid job across the boards just you know a three-point shot and that's kind of where the games going it. Uh, seems a [inaudible] those shots. So you know, uh, you gotta take the good with the bad and you continue to move forward and I think we will be we'll be ready when the time come.",1
"Well it's, you know, what the fourth game of a road trip looks like in October. Um, you know still trying to figure it out new team and, uh, you know despite not shooting the ball well I think you know on the road trip, uh, we still managed to finish 3-1 so it says a lot about what we're trying to do and defensively I think we taking strides in the right direction. Uh, we've had some flip-flop. Have some games we've been great and then not so great so uh you know we just still building finding ways to win games until we can really, really get it going. Oh yeah I did you know but you know he's buying in came back in and give us a lift down the stretch. Some timely blocks big possession. So that's what this team's made out of you know. Playing through stuff you know it's a long year guys gonna be banged up and it was the end of a road trip so it's all about holding together mentally. Yeah I mean, yeah you know at home you got all your home modalities, you got some remedies you got you know your bed you know it's you know fully eating. All those things that you know kind of taking away being on the road kind of limited with your resources and um we just gotta find a way take care of your body best you can ud get your rest and you know just come out and try to play hard and um we did about committee this entire trip you know guys we lost Zack and that was huge. And anything Anfree and Tyler with a huge game tonight you know guarding Diallo so you know this is what this team's built up and that's what you know really breeds the champion is whether in the storms, weathering the ups and downs throughout the season.",1
"Uh, that's just been our motto you know just fight to the finish. Uh, you know it haven't been pretty you know forth of late but we been getting wins and um you know just build a character one game at a time you know learn how to win these games it's gonna help us down the road. Um, oh just staying resilient you know. Just trusting your work um I got great teammates, a great coaching staff you know before every game you know always in my ear you know keeping me up and it starts in my defense you know. Anytime I'm out playing you know running you know bringing the energy you know everything else kind of falls in place and made a couple shots early got to the rim a little bit and I made my free throws. I'm just having fun you know all that stuff is super genuine and authentic you know if it happens in the middle of the game I just kind of stick with it and my teammates embrace it and obviously you guys do as well so that's the fun thing. Alright. Oh we just play with a different attitude, different swagger, uh little bit more physical. You know I think defensively we've ramped it up a little bit uh you know offensively things are still starting to come into place. Uh, didn't have Melo tonight so we know we had to win by committee and we did a good job got some good you know good production off the bench from [inaudible]. Gary Trent with two free throws there late so team effort. Thank you.",2
"Oh yeah um I'm just you know kind of getting back in my roots you know what I do you know defensively and uh you know still trying to iron things out you know offensively but fitting in well. Locker room has been great you know coaching staff has been great you know. Even seeing Paige and Vlade you know everyday just you know they you know encouraging me you know and it's been solid so far. Oh for sure you know it's been my calling card my entire you know basketball career is uh being able to get stops and uh you know disrupt other team's offense and you know tonight I was able to you know make some plays down the stretch offensively with some timely cuts and uh some solid passes. So it's all coming together you know prior to myself and playing a lot of defense and you know where the league is going you know it's kind of a second thought now um you know they're going guys they could put the ball in the cupboard uh you know it's a few of us still out there that take you know pride in defense and that's why I'm here. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so even, even the last time so I was able to watch the last time they played Miami down in Miami is just you know little things uh you know they're up late and um you know just having you know a veteran on the floor to kind of pick guys and right uh space defensively. I think tonight the defense you know was a big reason why we won. Obviously we had 29 this offensively but defense of stops. Ninety seven points. So they helped us out a lot and down the stretch is just all about being vocal and kind of taking something away from the game and I thought I did a good job of that on Robinson and you know guys is uh being in the right spot defensively making a tough one who knows. Right, yeah. Yeah. Well yeah I honestly don't, honestly think they did a really good job of holding together I think. You know when we came here there was still a little bit of optimism and how good this team could be and now wes just, the worker is starting to show. You know it's a long season you know the ebbs and flows of it - win streak lose streaks. You know it's all relative you know it's just like life and we got a bunch of resilient guys in here and guys still show up to work two great practices the last couple days and it rolled over into the night. I think you know in in been home which is a very underrated aspect to you know you can have a couple days in a row where you don't have you know the facilities and resources that you would normally have you're away from your family but with spending a couple days here in Sacramento uh able to you know get out and about you know play some golf have some great practices and spend some time my family so uh really you know kind of got my feet in the mud a little bit out here and let my hair down a little bit and was a you know came into the gym tonight you know feeling like I was home. Uh, yeah, but like I said mean you know when A-T and I came in you know just a couple weeks ago, you know it's pretty seamless. I played with Alex in Atlanta for a year and Jabaris you know I'm a fan of his from you know what he's been you know battling through with the injuries and just coming back and you know just playing a game and he loves. So you know we all cut from the same cloth you know a lot of guys in this league and just to add two more you know veteran guys have been around for a little bit it's going you know helped that experience down the stretch and in practices and so forth so on.",2
"Thank you man, appreciate it. Yeah Uh, you have it's great you know especially being a situation that we are now you know trying to get that eighth seed. I think, uh, you know we're planning like a desperate team and you know it says a lot you know about this group uh you know starting to break off with a big win against Memphis at home and carrying that over into the night. Yeah I mean no I mean shoot we got twenty-some odd games left and uh it's a crapshoot right now. Um, you know some teams are injured and uh some team it was just sink or swim moment. You see it every year team gets hot and makes it interesting in there at the end and we gotta have some lofty goals and we got the group to get it done. Uh, I think our attention to detail is it's gotten better. Uh, I think we've been disciplined for longer stretches, you know especially the night you know we didn't score the ball well but uh I think we hold on 11 I think 13 points in the first half, I mean first quarter so just following a game plan. Uh, the coaches do a great job of you know telling us what we need to go out there to do, to execute to give ourselves the best chance to win and uh you know when subs are made, you know that the energy picks up or stayed the same and we just have been riding. Uh wasn't much that needed to be changes to be honest uh you know but sometimes first blood uh and you know does help and you know I hadn't have had been having the best year so uh thing was a match made in heaven. You know a guy coming over desperate and a team in a desperate situation and we're kind of making it work right now. Oh, I love it. I mean these guys are grinding um you know and you know we just showing up every day is it's a loose group and obviously getting to be around [inaudible] and Bobby, Jack, uh, Doug, Christie you know and just I used to watch those guys growing up so um you know and I try to soak up as much information as I can so that's been great the weather's been great. Got a couple rounds of golf in Sacramento so life's good. Uh, you know we never felt like we were out of it you know. They made that run they're very talented team, uh, you know with a Finals MVP on the other side and Lou Williams and Montrez Harrell who's been having great runs over the last couple years so you got to expect that punch and uh you know we came to the hole you know there was wasn't any panic you know guys are still, uh, you know saying it right things we're still together, um, you know we believe in ourselves and you know uh we've been in situation before and that's what it takes to get wins like this is you know having a group out there that's uh you know resilient and you know. De'Aaron Fox down the stretch you know didn't get a couple calls but uh didn't get frustrated you know kept driving got to the free-throw line late and iced the game for us. Oh yeah definitely um you know that's a good thing about this league it's the family and you root for you guys you know regardless of what they're going through and um you know guys came in I think my first workout on the court in Sacramento uh we had a couple guys out there you know chirping at me you know kind of getting me going and that's the energy they bring and that's kind of my element and I love it and you know tonight was one of the results of you know just to work going in and uh you know they had a couple post ups and a three-ball is starting to fall and then defensively just you know flying around and uh makes it little easier when you got guys behind you that you know attention to detail is really high. You got your big in the right spot. I see a little man in the right spot, so things that things are great right now. Yeah you know this was a big win and you know with everything that's been going on those guys losing I think fifteen or sixteen in a row you gotta relish in these moments you gotta bottle up and really understand what it feels like and take that into the next day because it's hard to win this league it's hard to be a good team in this league and when we go on the road and then big games like this you know you gotta, you gotta, you gotta feel it We here you know here. We're behind him 110% you know he's just as fiery as uh any coach I've ever played with and sometimes you can look, looks like he wants to get out there but he's kind of chubby now so uh I think those days are over. Yeah I think so. I mean it's, it's a crapshoot at this point and uh you know some teams can handle the pressure some can't and that's what makes the NBA so special. You know uh the Pelicans have been playing well they're in front of us. San Antonio got a big win at Utah so I mean it's the fun time of the year you get to kind of uh you know side-eye some of the other scores some of the other teams and seeing what's going on and seeing where you fit in.",1
"What's that? Um, I don't really think I did. I mean looking at the team is just coming off a NBA championship a lot of seasoned veterans over there and um I mean they just made the only did little things down the stretch I thought you know hell of an effort by us and you know coming off a back-to-back. Uh, big emotional win and they were sitting here waiting on us and uh you know we gave my best shot uh and I thinkit's something we could be pround of and move forward. You know we can continue to play this way uh you know night-in night-out we will be where we need to be Uh it's been tremendous. Uh, you know we've had you know a lot of trades and Alex Len coming in uh myself you know rotations changed a little bit and but uh guys you know we still trying to figure it out getting Richaun back you know I think you know we were finding my stride at the right time you know a lot of basketball love and you know look at the team in front of us in the eight spot they got, you know tough gauntlet coming up so you know obviously tonight would have been a great win to get but you know you got to kind of roll the dice. We got a couple days off here and looking to get our legs back on under us and you know continue fighting. Uh, yeah I mean we got tomorrow also kind of take it easy it's been a heck of a week say the least with all the games and you know whatnot but it's a big game for us you know they're right there too - you know San Antonio is still in a mix. Um, well you can never count out Gregg Popovich down there so uh it's the fun time of the year you always kind of checking the scores and see what other teams are doing and see were you lining up by the end of the night and uh but you know I think we're sleeping really good around here with the play we had as of late went really good basketball right now. It is everything you know it's the league that you know can kind of consume you and um you know coach has done a good job. You know even with the crazy schedule like even this past week was just kind of guys coming in and getting recovery you know Kotov you know if you get shots up if he needs to. Get a lift in and just kind of you know keeping it light cuz you know these games gonna add up and the way we play fast-paced you know we need all the energy we can get. Like I said last time it's been a great couple weeks here and you guys have been getting better. Just over the past couple of weeks watching the De'Aaron Fox grow, uh [inaudible] here tonight. Bogi, you know just guys stepping up and hit some crazy I mean just you know ballsy shots tonight. Right. Uh, we got a couple vets out there on the court. I'll go out there myself. HB and you know they throw A-Land out there you know those guys have been around a little bit so uh we kind of know what we need to do if the starters come out like last night we just sustained and if they need a little pick-me-up we try to get it going defensively so uh you know our job is pretty simple. You know we got some talented guys in front of us in you know some nights that job's really easy. I mean you know it's just you know the inexperience you know. Toronto I say they started a bunch of vets and they understood it you know how how important it is to get out to get started against us because we're a very explosive team and we could turn it on so if you you know you start out and hold against it's gonna be a long night for you so I think they took that into consideration and you want to say we started and we finished end of the quarter I think 22 all you know. It's you know you got to take the good with the bad and you know when you're out there your name's called, just try to make a difference.",1
"Um, yeah we came a little flat so uh you know our jobs off the benches was to provide that energy. We did that a lot of our guys just me Michael Jr. Mason had some great plays. Devontae too. Malik, sorry. Uh, just make the right plays because either it's gonna go my way where I'm shooting or can help another teammate out so just reading it making it right playing and uh not trying to force anything but other than that just try and get the ball and put a another one up. Yeah, that was the most fun I had all year. Uh, it was just staying together there and we just you know worked hard. Um, I mean it's been tough but uh I got a great teammates and you know a great family system you know where I stay ready so I have to get ready. I just continue to work hard after the games and play or don't play. Just continue to do what I got to do. Uh yeah especially tonight uh because I was a little sad uh get the opportunity I guess say like I did tonight and three oh did a great job stay ready you know you never know what could happen tonight and I did that. Yeah yeah yeah yeah got to throw everything out of the window and you can't be selfish and uh be like we should plan, what should we plan? But, uh, other then that that's gotta stay ready you know. Whenever coach calls my name I should be happy, be ready and take over the opportunity and that's what I did tonight. Definitely. Um, this year has been tough for me. So a lot of guys have been coming up to me about how I have been mentally prepared, how I've been mentally doing and stuff. So like tonight, at the free throw line when he missed those free throws the first one I told him, ""You're by yourself, just relax, just do what you've been doing. You've been shooting great free throws all year this year. You've been working hard, just do your, just take your time."" He did and it ended out but it was still a great look. Yeah, we talked. We texted uh and he told me to pick it up, keep the energy going and then, um, and you know about that. I can't say anything but... Yeah I was sitting on the bench on the first quarter and I was asking PJ ""Dang, he got three starters out huh, that's crazy"" and then I look at the bench and I we only got only like four or five guys it's like ""Dang we just played back to back. We're gonna have to grind this one out"" and that's we did though. You know, we got a lot of a players know each other accountable you know throw [inaudible] 30 every night. Jokic goes 40 every night but he always makes the right plays and that's why we got great teammate. That's why we gotta be better and that's, I'm glad that we got the win against the lower, uh, lower team that's not doing good and that's the most important thing. Oh man, he's playing amazing. You know, he's uh, trying to learn um his stuff and he isn't just going out there playing full speed in the NBA and he didn't even play in college. People gotta respect that and uh understand that he's gonna have rookie mistakes and things like that. He's still learning the game and even for me. So uh credit to Michael Porter Jr. for working hard and continue to strive for whatever he wants. For sure.",0
"Uh, we got a great group of guys. So first of all I said you know it's about patience and you know getting the right guys and you know building a, uh, chemistry together and we did that in one day so it's it's it's testament to the coaches the the front office to bring great guys and leaders who want to play and defend and uh I think that's the main thing we're gonna take away from this. Uh, you know I'm always thankful thankful for opportunity so uh you know I've been putting in extra work to make sure that they don't regret it you know saying I want to make sure that you know when I come in um I'm the best player I can be. Non-stop. Yeah, that's what I am. Especially if the gyms in the hotel so they messed up doing that. It's a great system, you know we got, a lot of good guys like Karl-Anthony Towns and D-Lo didn't even play and Juancho Hernangómez who you know who we uh got a lot of great shooters around and we just move the ball you know that's the first time in and we get out in transition and try for space you know since we got so many great guys we gotta be able to push the pace get your shots up. I was in the zone. I can, uh, I couldn't see anybody hurt anybody I just it was just felt good and I great teammates passing the ball and get setting screens for me so it's not about just me you know I got other teammates helping me out. Uh, yeah, I guess so. Just a little bit you know I missed a few layups tonight um you know so I got allowed to work on you know. It's just a beginning. Yeah Definitely definitely so I'm like I'm like a mini vet I'm like a young vet for the team so I have to bring the the winning mentality from Denver over here and uh if that's watching extra film, making sure guys on time make sure I get extra guys in the gym in the morning and things like that just pushing each other and and holding each other accountable you know in the fourth quarter they came back on made a little run we can't do that you know great teams if something happens they can come back and win the game and that's not that's not acceptable so we gotta make sure you continue to game and keep our foot on the gas pedal. Everywhere I go. Everywhere I go. Once I get that O'Brien and everything else falls in place. That's how it goes. We're in a playoff race right now. 31 games left. It's not over. I'm pushing to get to playoffs. Straight up. shoot for the stars. Shoot for the moon and get stars if you if you going to make the playoffs we ended a great season we got going into other season. This is about another future. One day at a time.",0
"Um, we got a lot of great guys you know willing to get better and not you know, feel bad for ourselves. You know we like got a lot of positivity coming into this organization now so that's we're moving forward on. Yeah, definitely you know that was the first time we got to play with each other. Um, even in practice. We didn't get to practice really much uh so it was pretty good. You know we had a few driving kicks to each other that help didn't fall but you know we're trying to figure each other out. You know I had a backdoor from him we're just talking to each other and figuring things out but make this team better. Yeah. Definitely, definitely. Yeah, we always talk smack to each other we always, we're competitive so you know we're we're about having fun and making sure you know we push each other and being together on team it makes it way easier you know to push each other in practice and push other guys who are on our team. Um, you know, we got a, um, I mean the offense is there now that we know now we know that and now we got to figure out our defensive end to make sure we continue to play defense every night because now we can score just like in Denver. For us we could score any night just being able to mentally be a great team on a defensive end that's what great team do. You know we're not worried about offense and let defense dictate our game. Yeah, it's kind of weird you know and it's kind of weird because we have one more game and it's also break so we're going to be split up again so it's like I kind of wish we had a continuous thing going on where we could just continue playing but that's the NBA for you, you know. So we'll be ready we'll bounce back we make sure we practice hard get our chemistry back and most importantly got a game tomorrow. Um, just to switch it up a little bit you know. Uh, you know a lot of teams nowadays don't like the mid-range shot but um I think it's, it's, an efficient shot you know if you get downhill and then open up other things so now the big has to come up a little bit more and I can get downhill now more more, or more times than often or now that I have the big come up I can easily hit the pocket pass so uh there's little things like that you know I think all three levels is important to me but that's just my opinion on that. Yeah, definitely. It's not that hard because I know this team really well and when I study when I play against other teams I've studied them so when I came in here I knew a lot of their principles already. Um, so it just made it easier for me but um I mean a lot of it's knowledge and knowing things like that and communicating. That's the main thing, communicating. I can take for you guys right now and if I communicate with you guys will be able to do pretty well if I'm not... I mean technically, I'll be able to be able to get something done but but uh yeah it's all about communication is my main point. Huh? Huh? Yeah but I gotta keep my routine and I don't change you never know what's gonna happen so I keep my body right and make sure I do the same thing every day.",1
"Uh, it's weird but uh it's business so I gotta handle my business to make sure I do what I gotta do. Nah. Nah, nah. Just naturally, just ready to play get better no matter what team it is. Uh, uh, we have a good system on offense and defense where they need a two way kind of guard like me to be able to fit in and do things I need to do so it's easier for me to do that especially the way I play. Uh, just a lot because I knew something new change so everything every time I change happens it's different emotions never know but I'm good now. Ready to hoop. Yeah. Excited, excited about the opportunity. Uh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Out here we're gonna watch the fight together. Uh, Miami James is gonna take us to do some so we got a lot of different chemistry things that we're going to work on off the courts to help you get better. Nah, it's good it's still good you know everybody every team has that all-star break but we're all together right now we're all ready to work we're ready to get better. Here and there, yeah. It's always a brotherhood in NBA and no matter what team you're on even when I was on Denver I knew guys on Timberwolves so it's like a brotherhood thing. Probably not got business to handle Points? I mean opportunity for me to score is different but I'm not worried about points I'm worried about getting wins for my team and if I have to score more that's what I have to do but uh other than that I'm not looking to score every night. I'm looking to make the right plays for my teammates. Uh, We get on transition we got make quick threes we uh we defend a certain way. It's a lot of different things. Nah. Maybe I going to go in and do what I gotta do. Whatever it is I'm do what I got to do whether they're happy for me or not. Uh, I mean any and every player is always worried about what's going to happen so I mean I really don't know until they tell me so I can't really worry about that and focus on basketball when I was in Denver. Uh, I mean it's a business so like that is not about personal life for anything like that it's just a straight business so that's that's how you got to take it.",1
"We've been here for a while. It's not like, you know, we had the filling but uh um you know we finally kind of figured out how to work together on the defensive end and that kind of took away a lot of pressure from offense and throughout the game we saw the game with our mindset um we went on our regular swung to the game but you know we got back had the energy, remain we kept the tempo of the game at our pace and uh we were able to you know win the game. We punch back. Uh, we were able to like find, you know the, the kind of the the thing that made made allowed us to to you know to the punch again and uh. Um, yeah, it was a good feeling. Um, you know if we work together defensively pretty well we were tight you know for the most part obviously they did good team and they move guys around and have a bunch of shooters. Um, they, you know, they execute real well so, uh, you know, even with that like I thought we did a pretty good job of communicating and uh sacrificing for one another. Because I love him. Yeah, that's why. He wants to jump I wasn't gonna jump so I'm I'm gonna pick you up I can't jump. So he want to jump and do the you know that whatever the shoulder high shoulder thing I'm not gonna jump. I have limited jumps and I'm gonna save them. Really good, really good. He, I mean he shot with confidence just like I did last game. Um, that was a big relief when you see somebody shooting like that, with confidence and and just you know without a conscience and just let it fly, it just is it, you know gives you a lot of oxygen through your offense and and it makes the other team worry about somebody else. His length is very unique um, I want to kiss him too. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's tough I mean things are going to continue to go on and in one way or another. Um, now we gotta concentrate and come back and and do the same thing in September it's, it's just the nature of the NBA no matter what you do right now. You want to carry on the momentum and, and, and, and, and that togetherness in the chemistry, the little chemistry that we built tonight, um that confidence, um, and carried on to the you know to the next game. Um, so that's, that's uh, that's important part because like we're gonna see, the line-ups are going to be what gonna be, and you know we don't have a practice tomorrow. So, that's it's gonna go be a little tougher so we'll keep it, you know even more easier for guys and simple and pretty simple but, um, you know we defend like that it's, you know, it's fun Yeah and, and, and yeah sure yeah you know. You, you, you felt it you got, you know, confident and uh and especially because I got the steal in the pocket pass on that, you know, that play they kept running um that's what really got me going. Um, you know somebody communicated from the back that they were playing the short action. Um, Ingles goes right he's really good at that. Sabonis to his left hand so uh, you know, I made a good read and played that pocket pass and that's what really got me going I think, and that's the reason why I shot the three. Sure, sure. I don't know. Why not?",3
"With the national team playing, um, against [inaudible] actually. Yeah, in under sixteen tournament in France. Yeah, I remember that. No, no, no. Elvis and uh, that was it, but Elvis. When? That um, September I think. Um, we first um flew out in somewhere on September we stay at the Marriott. I was supposed to go to, to White Station first. I, I remember Coach [inaudible] came in and picked me up and took me to the high school I was just amazed how big it was and how many people were there and then I'm just like they explained the rules that it, you know, we have. It was a public school what to leave in the area and [inaudible] pick up picked out a place on a Germantown and I'm like, oh well, that's not going to work. And uh I had to change schools. Yeah, that's how I. Uh, went there for like two days because I they told me like like they explained to us if you go there for a third day you're not eligible to play basketball, um, wherever I was going. Awful. I, I remember guys asking me, ""what grade you in?"" and I'm like, ""I'm Marc, I like basketball"" and they was like ""Okay, what class you on?"" and I had a little sheet of paper with all my classes and I was just showing that like is what I'm going like this is where I'm going. They probably think I'm like Tom Hanks in the movie [inaudible], yeah some good times. We couldn't get stops. I think they were you know we could we got too spread out I think you know we became too detatched from the ball and that you know create a little confusion on us. They do a good job of finding the open guys and moving guys around. Um, yeah they're good job and off the top this guy, [inaudible] have just been switching guys from the, you know, from the weak side to the strong side kind of like crowding the paint a lot and that yeah we couldn't really stay with them. Yeah, no, no, no. I mean I think I mean in the last few games I've been real assertive with my shot and trying to you know be really aggressive, um, from the get-go. I'm not trying to get anybody else going or trying to defer to anybody else just like they was there and we'll see what happens. Forty eight minutes, yeah. Forty eight minutes, yes, which [inaudible] it's really easy. Not that, but when you're at home, you know, sitting at home and uh before the game I kind of go through the whole mind preparation you go through the whole process. Um, the drive in everything you know but then you kind of smile a little bit too because you're like wow like you know could be it, maybe not but it's been a hell of a ride. You know you know all the fans, all the love you get from everyone, it's fun, it's just, just great. You don't know. I don't know. I try not to think about it. I know tomorrow I'm turning 34 tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow I'm turning thirty four and my family gave me a great um birthday party yesterday at my house and that's all I care about. Like the rest, like you know they don't. Yeah, yeah my wife made a cake I'm like my daughter you know picked out the flavor and the color so it was yeah it was pink and strawberry. Yeah. No, no just a three and four, three and four. Better that way. Better that way. No, no, again, I did not do it that way. Just to make sure. Uh, I, I, I have no control over the situation, like this is how you would approach it. Like I have zero control over it. All I can do, or all I can control is how I interact with my teammates, how work with them and um my effort out there. That's that's all I can control. The rest, I can't control it. Therefore, I can, you know, spend too much time thinking about it even though you mind does wonder sometimes you know what's going on, what's gonna happen, what's not, but then you know kind of reel it back and, and thankful for the things that you do have and and how great it's been. This is the, I mean, you know, they start switching and bringing guys from, you know from the low side. Um, you know our turnovers. Um, you know the ball didn't get to paint as much so we made those triggers with the switch. Um, we became really predictable and we saw what's our error in the third you know what they were trying to do they make that adjustment at half time and uh, we did not you know found, find at least that the next option. I was sixteen, sixteen, sixteen. I think, yeah I didn't have a sweet sixteen I, what I turned seventeenth when I you know when my first birthday here was seventeenth, I was a junior in high school. Again, you control, you in control. I can't like, you know like. What did I get? My wife got me a lot of like little sailing souvenirs. You know she knows she knows that I love sailing and uh out on the water, um. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, obviously. I rent a boat, I don't have a boat. Uh, um, but yeah. Fifty footer, fifty five. What you get to rent is beautiful. I like, I like. They gonna do what's best for the franchise and uh, uh we had our talk. I hope I wanted to stay and like, you know, I think they they got to do what they have to do and they gotta think what's best for franchise going forward. If that's without me and making a great asset, that's great and I'm all for it. And if, if it's with me I'm, you know, all for it. So either way like they will do what they think is best and you have to respect that and deal with that. Yeah. Yeah, uh well in Detroit. In Detroit. In Detroit. Yeah I was. Yes I was. Basketball, four points, traveling, played awful. He traveled, he felt down. I think those guys, you know, were way too physical for him. And Detroit, I remember Ben Wallace just eating him um, but yeah, you know after that he. I don't know, I don't know. That's that's pretty crazy. This whole ride has been you know, uh like a saw in a, you know, in the [inaudible] at least this whole time. That's, that's pretty impressive. Um, my son is only two. I'm not even joking. And Adrian, my younger brother decided not to go that route. My dad is a little older. Maybe, maybe, you know, maybe I got traded to San Antonio when Pop comes back. Who knows. I mean, that'd be pretty funny. I would like, I would be like, there's a part of me that's like ""hey"", he still has a place here. Still, he still has a place here. Yeah the same place. The same place. My parents live in it. My parents. I mean, my parents been here the whole ride so that's that's, you know. [Inaudible] When did you start to like Memphis. Yeah. I was completely blown away, you know, with the culture. And, and, and, you know, the access to different things and during the high school it was kind of like the movie, dream type of deal for me. Definitely different from what I was used to. Um, and that was pretty cool. Um, I loved the atmosphere, the game, I loved that. The popcorn, the smell like all those things were new to me I love to eat them too obviously but um it was cool. It was very different to what I was used to and uh, I fell in love with the people. Like, how they treated me, like for me to you know be known from Spain and coming over here and getting the love, you know, the warmth too and that felt really good because you feel really insecure when you move into a new place but when you get that type of uh love and warmth, that's all you. That makes you feel very secure. No problem. Ah, man, they had, they had, they had a great team. THey had a great team. They had [inaudible] that time. Um, he was really, really good. And they had [inaudible] a lot of players and then I remember [inaudible]. That was the team with Andrew Allen. That was, that was fun. Really close option. That was a, that was the only option that really like considered like uh. Yeah Then I went back to Spain. No, I think it was like what, what how it went down with Calipari like he came in and watched a couple practices I went and had like a you know, not officially, we're having like pickup games you know and I was there and uh you know they told me like would you be a part of this and I'm like, okay I'll think about it. My mom was all for it. My mom wanted me to stay here I mean she still talks about it today. I mean you know what, I am 350 pounds so I'm not happy with who I am I got to go back and kind of like rethink things a little bit and Barcelona gave me an option. They just came off winning you know the Euroleague that year, the Spanish Cup and the Spanish league so I'm like I have a chance to be part of that team? And then kind of like reset things I have to have to give it a try. My dad, the only thing that my dad make sure is like I did not get paid that you know you say you're gonna be a professional but without the pay. ""Thank you, I appreciate that."" He has money, but yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, they sure like that, that year you know really what you're, you know, getting paid for and like being around those guys but you a sponge. You just see everything kind of like, internalize it. Later on, it made sense. Right away didn't make sense though. Pfft, I think the scale, the scale just went over, probably like over three hundred fifty. Without a doubt. And I, and I worked at it too. Back in Spain. Back in Spain. Yeah. No, no, no. No, kilos are less. [inaudible] I would have been like ""No!"" It wasn't tough it was like ""okay."" Back then it was the big big mac. Big big big big mac. Supersize. Everything supersized. And I remember those times and yeah I had Diet Coke though. I, I, I [inaudible]. Diet Coke [inaudible] And the Mac, the Mac Burger with no topping, without the topping. I was watching [inaudible] No, Johnny couldn't drive. Johnny was fifteen at that time. And you know that was my second year, that was my senior year. Um, yeah, but it was fun I cannot lie to you. I still, like, two of my teammates came to the game tonight. Two of those teammates, um [inaudible]. Yeah, they, they, they front [inaudible] like best friends they were the guys that I hang out with the most. Um, they took care of me. No, no they keep They come, obviously. They come a lot and they, they took care of me at that time and that's, I'm super thankful for that because through basketball, um, I'm pretty sure that every class I was there was a teammate in every class. So whatever class they went to like okay. Yeah, [inaudible]. I made sure I had a teammate in every class. Um because, after, I felt really secure around them. That was it, right. I don't know. I don't know. I don't. I don't know, I don't know. I mean, I mean, I have to think about it. There's a lot of years. And, and try to summarize it in one word, one phrase is hard. Um, but overall, very positive obviously. There's like, I mean, I mean, just think about it. I came here knowing shit and, and, and now I'm a father of two. My son was born you know in Poplar Woods you know, my son was born here, um my daughter go to school here. Has all her best friends from here. Like, you know, I'm. Yeah, that was not my choice. That was, that was definitely not my choice but she was happy. For forty eight minutes. No, I mean I'm sure you have to. It's part of it. And and I love the learning process of of it and it makes you learn more about yourself. Um, you kind of, you know, go through it and it's it's not ideal, it's not what you want, but there's a lot of learning through it and uh, not that I'm liking it, but it's, it made you realize some things and and it's kind of cool. Yup, yup, no problem.",2
"Um, you know it's everything is beyond your control I use so you know, so you know you're not really surprised about anything you just, um, waiting to see if something's going to happen or not and that's about it. That's all you can do. Um, right. No, I think what you know we're more concerned about, you know, trying to be a good team and and getting back into the team that we want to be more than anything else. I think you know we all understand that the other side it's, it's beyond our control and there's nothing we can do about it so, so it's, it's, it's pointless to be you know speaking into one other. We we all know you know what what can happen uh but we know we know as well that it might not happen so who knows? Yeah, but it doesn't change the situation. Whatever happens, happens and that's, that's all you can do it now so you think about it more stressing out about it or not, it doesn't change the fact and um they do what they think is best and uh and that's it. We've been speaking about the same thing over and over again and it's not gonna change. So I do the same stuff with my family at home. Uh, obviously we kind of wander around a little bit like if it happens you know where where would it be and and when would it be in and the same time like I said, we know that what maybe it doesn't happen. You don't want to let your mind wander now or wander too far. Oh yeah, yeah I'm preparing for that. Yeah, yeah so what happened to Tyreke so we do have a track record and uh and I don't know like I said they never approached me telling me to shut down and, and you know you getting traded for sure and uh you know all I know is that they were taking calls in and they were gone from there. Like, when, there was not much more of a message or much more information share at that point. Um.",0
"Um, well I was obviously after you know eleven years of player and uh and almost you know I got there as a teenager so. Uh, you know we kind of expected that something could happen and then it seemed like nothing was gonna happen so uh you know it happened and we all know we knew our destination. You know we got real excited. Uh, you know because it gives you a chance to compete uh at the highest level and uh you know once Masai called and talked to some of the guys in there and uh, everyone said about this. You know, the same about making a run to the title and uh you know that gets you know your juices going and, uh, makes it real excited. I mean I posted something in social media that was pretty accurate maybe not the the quality of the singing but but that that's a kind of the feeling that you get. Um, you don't know, you don't know you can tell, but you can't control. Um, you know and everyone it's talking about it and everybody is asking you and you just don't know. Um, but as far as the routine goes the habit is the same like I stayed with my family and my kid and you know there's a pretty good distraction to that. Uh, for sure. I mean I play with Kyle in [inaudible], played against Kawhi and Danny for many years. Have battles against most of these guys in the playoffs. Um, [inaudible] you know, you know, one of the main assistants here and being the head coach of the national team um can help me speed up the process. Um, then at the end of the day is basketball. Um, you know I think the transition is going to take however long but at the end a we talk about basketball and and you know try to win. Which, I know. Yeah, yeah. That's uh, that has been the last 11 years of those two teams. Um, just help guys and help the group uh be as good as we can be come April and May and June. So that's that the my main job and and see um how can I help and you know when things get a little you know hectic in there just, you know, help everyone. Yeah, yeah uh we got on the plane I think was around five thirty, five, six I was already at the airport it happened really fast. Uh, yeah. It happened really fast that was. I didn't expect that you know to be the case. I had but you know I think here I'm like okay it's time to do this, it's time to go. Um, I hope so I'm not one hundred percent sure but I hope so. That's a part that I don't know I mean physically I'm ready to play the part that is out of my hand is like all the other stuff that I'm working right now. Hosa was one of the first guys to reach out and, and, you know how much it was gonna love the organization and the city and uh he was very excited so you know he was. Well, it's not like you know, I didn't have a time, like he was excited just you know he saw everybody knows what you know what kind of team the Raptors have and and adding me and he knows what kind of player that I am you know what they trying to do so exciting obviously. Um, uh, I don't know trying to learn the plays learn the schemes as fast as possible. Um, learn you know the players tendencies. Watch the last two games of the team in the last twenty four hours. You know, trying to learn all the plays they have a lot of plays and just trying to pick up as much as possible and you know have a little patience. Um you know, just play ball. One day at a time and and with patience. I'm not trying to rush anything um you know and as a player you just you know I said you want to help the team accomplish their goals that's where this is about and um and for me and the other the other side is gonna be easy. Um, like I said it makes you you know it makes your juices going. It makes like okay, this, this is it. And you're going for a chance of you know to the very top and what else you can ask for as a player than that chance. Say that again. Obviously, yeah, as a player that's that what you want. That's what we try to build um for so many years in Memphis and it didn't work so I'm very thankful for the team you know making this possible as well I'm thankful to repair to decide to train me here and and obviously um the Toronto organization for believing in me so just just um ready to go. I don't know. While you playing it's kind of a you know it's not like I retired um but I really obviously I'm my relationship with Memphis and, and the team goes back a long time and I gave it my all. How you know maybe sometimes it wasn't perfect but I gave everything I had and I'm planning to doing the same thing in Toronto. Uh, that's the only way I know how to play. Um, dedicating yourself to the game to the city to the fans and my family also is very excited. My wife and two kids you know they know they're gonna need different mascot now so it's going to be kind of cool. I mean not just him I think you look at the team and they're built of every guy like you know guys have been through the playoffs so many times they've probably seen you know the highest talent and they have all the schemes to kind of uh a defeat that talent or at least try to so when you put all those guys together you know it's all the option that you have, it's a good feeling. Um, we'll see. I mean you know we both I think are team players that want to win and and uh everyone in the locker room you know we feel the same way about that. So it's gonna take a little time I'm sure uh for adjustment but uh, um you know it's all about winning. No, I wouldn't. I think we just you know we gonna just see how it goes and and play it by ear and whatever. Yeah. I don't think it's right now that what matters to me obviously I'm still for myself is how we can be the best team we can be um when the team mattered most. Obviously this is a change and, and um, and we adding some things and I'm sure we're gonna add more things as the week's pass. Um, we have what 26 games left in the season? So during those games is how much stuff can we um improve and do better and get more of in order to you know to peak at the right time. [Inaudible] Yeah, yeah, we talked and uh and uh I said they all mentioned you know, run for the ring and to me that's very exciting. Um, yeah I got a big bag for the break to Memphis so um I'm all packed. Even a couple more bags ya know. Yeah, no and Memphis is not as warm as Los Angeles you know. It's not as cold as Toronto but it's definitely not as cold as Toronto. Um, what I learn about my new teammate, they all scrappy. Uh, you know they all compete on the ball um, they all communicate very well um and just learning you know trying to learn their tendencies and learn the plays as well. Learn this, the schemes defensively there's a lot of learning that has to go on. I'll only be here for you know twenty four hours but, um, you know it's really exciting. Uh, yeah I actually ask him a lot of questions about you know what you know what should happen and in each situation um but any day like it's you know it's about reads and reactions and understanding where you're gonna get the ball and and what kind of shot you're gonna get and it's feel good. Well, yeah you know, it's not like my first time, my first game um but uh you you have to keep it simple um and you know it's only going to get better it's all gonna get more comfortable out there. Um, but you know the level of energy like that's not you know that's not up for debate you have to bring that either way so. Um, you know just big one step at a time. Yeah We got a lot of uh good looks obviously we didn't shoot the ball really well but we got a lot of open shot and you know that's all you want um defensively. You know we kept fixing things that kept happening we could have rebounded a little better um but uh the bounce the bounce that the ball was coming up the rim sometimes were a little you know it's short of very long so sometimes the bounces you know it's a high-speed come at the rim and it's you know challenging but we gotta do better job of boxing out. It's all-in, it's all-in. The mindset, um, the mindset all-in you know there's no there's no nothing it's just it's clear goal it's one goal and that's to play for for a championship and, uh, and I'm gonna give it my all like it's not nothing else that matters but that. [Inaudible] [Inaudible] Anything suprise you today? Uh, I mean is how many fans from the Raptors were on the stands. Memphis fans, we get some fans on the stand but not as many as you guys so or us now. So, uh, but yeah I mean it's you know like the amount of energy that you feel around around the city to its great and everybody talks about the same thing.",0
"Um, yeah, give you, give you the the butterflies in your stomach when uh when you get those. Um, made you feel like a kind of a rookie again and it's a good feeling it's a great feeling to have. Um, eventually yeah. In the third quarter once you know you get the ball more in your hands and you start to make reads and understanding what the defense is trying to do and guys moving around uh obviously you know you get more comfortable. So yeah, I guess you know a little better than uh game one and it's gonna continue to get better slowly. There's going to be some ups and some downs, but defensively I thought that you know we we try to do the right thing. And everybody's communicating, and, and trying to fix mistake mistakes. Um, I definitely got more comfortable and uh and uh obviously you know there's a few things I can do on the floor on both ends and uh and but mostly just making plays on both ends and if it's you know communicating or taking away something than the other guys want to do um on the offensive end and offensive leads being able to score stretch the floor or pass not allowing the defense to just be, you know, uh, predict what you're going to do. Yeah when you see the ball goes through a net uh a couple times you know you start to feel good and you see your teammates and your coach is getting really excited as well so it's a good it's a cool moment to have obviously but you know then a little tired, uh, um, and have to come out. I don't know, I don't know. Uh, he's the coach he knows his players and he's know he knows what he's seen before. Um, I'm an unselfish player by nature when I see a pass somebody open, regardless who it is you know um I'm gonna throw it to them and and I encourage guys to keep moving and moving without the ball because if they get behind you know their defender or defender made a mistake um you know we're gonna make them pay for it. And the thing is we haven't really practiced yet as a team so um in all the little chemistry things and in turn out and and cheat plays that we can do. You know, still really early and we uh just lost Fred, so the thing that we had going on from the first game um you know today was a little different so everything everything is gonna be an adjustment. I don't know. I don't know. Um, I don't know. I don't know who does and who doesn't but I use it. I use it. I'm comfortable with it especially down the middle if they allow me to get to that point um I'm really comfortable with it. If they take that away you have other moves that are that I'll do but it's a good move it's hard to stop when it's going in. Yeah. And communicating what other things trying to do as well. Um, communicating to the to the bench what plays they're trying to run, um tendencies things that I've picked up over the years as well I'm just trying to help everyone. Yeah well yeah communicate a lot um with everyone and I believe that that you know that's important and an important part into winning. Communicating what you see and and and obviously asking questions and sometimes give an answer as well so you know I think it's a two-way street.",1
"That was my career high? I wasn't really [inaudible] just trying to win. No. I wouldn't call it pressure. You know, I been around here for a while and it's just in me to be a leader. You know these young guys, that's what I'm to do. I'm here to help guide them. And help them. You know on and off the court and I take pride in that. You know for me it's not really people asking me to do it, it's me taking on that challenge. You know at the end of the day, we wanted to win. You know we definitely took a positive step competing with a team that good. One of the favorites to win the championships. For us to be in the game the entire game. And actually have a big lead on them. You know, it says a lot about us. We competed our asses off. We played hard. There was one stretch where the game just got a little wild. A lot of technical fouls [inaudible]. Nah, I just you know, they did lose last night. I just felt some accountability for the whistle being blown early on. Me personally, you know. I just prefer to get a win. I don't care if it gets going [inaudible]. Regardless, this is a championship team. So for us to come with that type of intensity and with a game plan and play as hard as we did, that's a good step for us. We compete. We compete. You know, we compete. Our point guard isn't here. You know that part. We been competing. We fall short and you know, but like I said, we taking steps each and every game and I thank God that I can tell you that we getting better. Especially offensively. Uh, you look at our numbers offensively and scoring in the paint, I think it's a big step. And defensively. You know, two games ago we kept a team under eighty points damn near so a good Brooklyn Nets team. So you know, if you look at the numbers they can tell you that we getting better. Guys are coming together, guys are playing their role. And you know, we having fun. You know the NBA is about opportunity. Being able to get out there and show it took me a longer time to get on a team when it wasn't needed as much. But like every team I've been on, I've always played my role, to the best of my ability. And I'm happy to be able to showcase my talent and take my game to another level and continue to help the team and it pushes the win. Yeah I got hit during the game. It just stiffened up so, it's nothing. I should be good by Tuesday. No. I'm in New York. You just asked me that last week. It a'int going to change. Man I'm here. I love our team. I love our future.  I just want to be a part of it and help the young guys grow and [inaudible] the great players they gon' be. That was the reason why I made the decision to come here. Going back to the decisions I made, along with a lot of other things. You know, I'm here and you know I enjoy the organization and I enjoy the players they got here. And I want to be here a long time.",3
"A lot of female tendencies on the court. Flopping and throwing their head back the entire game and, like I said it's a man's game and you just get tired of it. Obviously at the end, that was very unprofessional. They winning the game against a good team and you know, who does stuff like that? No the steal was cool, you know it is what it is. But when you step back and shoot a three you know what I'm saying and try to you know, low-key like rub it in that they're winning. You know, it's just unprofessional and it's soft this game is soft, the league is soft, it's just you know [inaudible]. It's just very woman-like.",0
"You know we had to have our energy up, we defended one of our best defensive games all season. We held them to eighty five points for four quarters. You know we played well, our teammates was moving the ball and guys making shots. You know, we stayed relentless. Communication I think. You know. Dennis Smith Jr. did a great job coming in and running the team and also Kadeem Ali coming he just did a great job but just, you know, hounding the ball. Staying communicating with everybody on the team and you know, we did a great job. This s a good win for us. I just stayed aggressive. Early on it wasn't going down for me and a couple guys on the bench said later in the game it's going to click and when it clicked I just kept going and I got hot.",3
"You know, it's just trying to fit in and trying to do what I'm effective at and you know just being myself and just playing basketball. Our communication level was high and once we got a steal, we was gone. We was pushing the change trying to find an open guy and, you know, we was knocking it down. And we just kept pushing, we kept pushing and we did a good job. Uh you know it's definitely important. Coming to this team, my focus is just to bring that intensity and that veteran leadership and at this point I'm really not too worried about scoring or hitting threes. Playoff time, as the level goes up, you know that's what I'm preparing for.",0
"It was cool man, just trying to pick my spots and just see what other guys like and play off them. It just maakes the game easy. I think it will help it a lot. Being able to play with the big and you know playing down in the seams and playing a bit of pick and roll with four man and three and being able to spread and just make plays for everybody and make the game easier for the guys and I think that's what we did tonight. Just talking before the game, I asked him where you like the ball at and, you know, if he likes to roll, if he likes the pocket pass. Me being a vet just trying to fill him up because we gon be in a lot of those positions so just seeing how they feel him up.",2
"We gon get ahead, we gon work at everything [inaudible]. The main focus is on the championship and that's what we gon do. We focusing on a lot of details. Making sure everyone is comfortable on the offense. We run it ten twenty times. We got me and Reggie in here. We going over it extra. The guys really focusing on the goal and you know it's fun [inaudible]. [inaudible] I love him. When I was on the other team, when I was on the Knicks, one thing I always told them is there's a helluva coaching staff. And top to bottom I enjoyed being on that job. A lot of detail [inaudible] That's my brother, man. If he's going to LA then [inaudible] all the time.",3
"Yeah it is. Uh I think we we had a once again great beginning of the game. Uh we knew that we needed to set the tone, uh especially defensively. We were very concerned about uh [inaudible] uh tonight and we did a great job. [inaudible] did a great job. And uh uh offensively, we actually we actually did great. We had thirty one [inaudible] which is awesome. We played selfless. finding each other. So it was really fun tonight to play. Yeah uh we are. And it's it's all coming uh from practice. They're practicing great uh each day and we are improving that communication that we didn't have before. And uh uh at the game you know it's it's not just about one guy. It's not about just one matchup. It's about all the team having good communication. And uh so far we we are improving there. And um you know uh offensively playing finally the way we have to play. You know enjoying a lot of scoring a lot of points, sharing the ball and uh especially on the fast-breaks. It's been a lot of fun uh for me I think, for the team too, for the fans. Uh I'm very happy for them and because I see their the people are starting to be very excited about about the Bulls. Maybe this is just my thought but we can feel that when we are playing out there. And it's you know it has not stopped now we we need, I know we have a tough schedule. Tough two games in the road. But if we continue to play with this level, competing, you know. I'm sure we're gonna have our options and just uh playing simple. Uh why not? I mean why not? I mean we are going there to win of course. Uh I cannot promise that we gonna win but we gonna do our best for sure. Uh the way we've been playing the last seven games since it was completely different. And uh we're gonna do our best. We'll go now to Clevelend do our job in the morning and um try to try to win. Uh I think the system has been great. You know it's been great at uh especially offensively. How we, how we want to play, what pace we want to play. Um finding the guys at you know the right moment, uh pushing down balls, sharing the ball. It's all about this there is no like too many isos. Of course when you have sometimes a good matchup we want to find a guy like we we did in the beginning of the game with [inaudible]. We we passed to him twice, he he scored twice. So it's I think we're just playing smart smart. And taking a good decision and defensively helping each other, having trust from your brother behind and uh it's all about that. I don't think I'm sure it's [inaudible] practice. You know, we're practicing that way long time ago. And sometimes uh when we are taking some bad shots, Freddie stopping us and telling listen guys you gotta take a better decision, better shots. And uh I think we are understanding more each other now. Understanding the guys who's next to you. How he likes to shoot, when we need to give him the ball and it's all about the time I think. And uh right now, we are finding the break how to play those games and uh how to play with [inaudible]. I think so. We were one of those guys everybody thought bad. And we were bad boys but now we're kind of good guys again. You know those guys [inaudible] for us to play well. So but people need to have patience too. We're a young team and uh a lot of new guys this year [inaudible] different direction. Two guys [inaudible] develop. I think the way the team is going. It's it's great now. Uh [inaudible] playing great. Uh crease down you know. And team is playing that good so it's still all of what they wanted before.",3
"Uh it's good. Uh they you know, they've been great with me so far. Everybody you know from the organization from the teammates. And uh I love this city. You know uh I really think I can you know can just [inaudible] here. Uh unfortunately we you know had a tough schedule. We didn't win since I'm here yet. It's been three games just but uh I'm sure we're gonna bounce back. There's another game tomorrow, but I feel really comfortable you know. Playing with AD and Rajon you know. And uh it's just about a little bit more time. We need all to understand how to play with each other and I'm looking forward. You said it all. He's one of the best. You know and uh he's one of the best in everything. Running the ball, going low post, one on one, faced up you know like running to the basket. So, he does all those things and you know especially defensively like when they go by you, like you know like he has your back. And he's huge. And but the biggest thing you know, he's a great guy. He's a great guy, great teammate. You know and uh it was a privilege to play you know against him before but now it's even better to be by his side. I think consistency. You know being more consistent. You know working a lot on my body. Doing a lot of jobs during the summer. A lot of jobs shooting, one on one, low post. You know I'm getting stronger. Putting twenty pounds in my in myself. So I think you know that's all the job I did. You know it's coming up now. So that's the biggest thing. Top three. I think yeah. I don't know if, I'm not sure he's gonna be numebr one but obviously top three. He just turned eighteen. He has a lot of experience. You know and uh and the way he played with [inaudible] in [inaudible] and [inaudible] this summer was just impressive. And um I'm glad that uh he's having the best year you know so far. And uh [inaudible] gonna help him to be to be at the top of the of the draft. You know so and a lot of people is talking about him right now so he's gonna be great.",3
"Amazing. Uh to be honest, I'm not surprised. I know he's in crazy numbers but uh we all can know he's Anthony Davis. Everybody's expecting a lot from him. But especially after all-star break he came like a beast, like scoring so easy, playing with a lot of confidence and uh I think he's playing in the both sides. He's not just playing offensively well, he's extremely playing great defensively. And uh that's the biggest reason why we're six and oh right now. Yeah uh it was always a pleasure playing against him. Uh but now we're teammates so there's a lot to learn. And uh I think he's he's a great worker too. He's dedicated and uh he really care about this team. Care about winning. So I think that energy you know it's uh helping him to be that successful. Be that consistent. And uh you know uh we really all try like to follow him kinda and do you know whatever we can to you know to be the best team we can. But there is a lot of room for all of us to improve. But right now we are we are playing well. It's like uh game by game. You know we have to focus that way. We know that all games is gonna be important right now and uh everybody fighting for something. We were fighting for being in the playoffs. The best position of playoffs. So to be consistent you know we had to build it from this point we [inaudible] now. And uh uh, we know that we could do better. You know especially defensively, we had we lately had  little bit slow start but uh then we pick up our energy, our confidence. So uh I'm sure you know we we're concerned what we have to do and we're gonna do our best to win more games as we can. But has to be a game by game",2
"We had a good start to the game. Uh especially that first quarter. You know we were three points down. And I think uh especially after the first quarter, they played with more physicality than us. They made some tough shots. And uh we we never felt very confident today. I don't know what was the reason, we obviously missed AD. But we had enough to beat this team. So but uh we'll be fine. It's just it was not one of those games you feel comfortable uh playing out there. We we were shooting terribly from the three-point line tonight too. So uh we'll be fine we just need to keep working hard and get the next one. [inaudible] first of all because we knew we didn't play with AD which is out best player. So hopefully he will be back next one. And but we just need to stick together. We we know that what we've been doing so far has been doing great thing together. And uh defensively I think we need to step up a little bit more. Especially the defensive transition, they made a lot of points. Uh and the rest offensively just playing our best. Sharing the ball and uh find wide open guys. I think uh today we didn't find uh wide open guys too many times but we just didn't make the shot. So this is gonna be like that but we even like that we need to try to find a way to beat the teams. So but today was not one of those days. And uh we need to get we need to keep moving forward. Could be. I think uh you know when you, especially when you win, I think your confidence is like high. But when you lose, it's kinda a little like wakeup you know. We need to keep doing what we were doing before. We need to keep working hard. Because there is a lot of room for us to improve as a team. There's always that of course. So uh you know I know that uh I know how confident is this team. I know all those guys during the locker room, how they talk what they think and uh each game is gonna be very importnat from now to the end. And uh I'm sure we're gonna do our best job next game. For tonight? Uh I mean it's not easy for him because a lot of the games, he's guarding the best player there. And you know and we're kind of expecting for him to be leader of the offense too. So uh I think he might be a little tired today too which is normal. And uh he was guarding Beale tonight. So it was really a tough matchup. And we have a lot of, we have back to back too so before that then. It was just not our day and uh we'll be fine. We just need to stay positive and uh get back to more of the practice facility to get some work.",1
"First of all it's great to be back with the squad. I miss those guys, I miss being here and uh, but today I think uh, second half we play with much more effort. Defensively, we step up, we trust each other. Offensively, share the ball and we play simple. It's all about that. Effort and play simple, because we have a - a lot of weapons offensively so, it was all about the defense and uh, great win. We needed to protect the court and uh, now we just need continue working. Uh, first half I didn't feel that great, especially like, you know, spacing the floor like I didn't feel comfortable because I've been twelve games off but second half it was way better. You know the - the guys who are talking to me, uh I had a lot energy especially that second half and I - I just want to have fun. It was all about that so uh, it was great day. Uh, I'm glad uh, I was able to play, we won this game so it's - it's all that matters. I did and uh, I appreciated those guys they - they've been showing me all the love since I came uh, last year so uh, it's - it's been amazing playing for those fans. I - I Love New Orleans, I love the - this crowd and uh, I just - I just want them to continue coming to our games and uh, support us any way.",2
"Yeah, I mean, after that game in - in LA, which we play great, I didn't had a - one of those nights that I felt comfortable and scoring zero points, uh, it was important for me to get back that - that confidence and, you know, just to feel important, you know, to feel - to - to feel - to be with the guys, offensively, defensively, and um, we - we start great, we had a great first half, you know, especially defensively, playing for each other, offensively was beautiful, sharing the ball, scoring a lot, and uh, the third quarter, you know, they got hot, uh Steph was making all those trees, it was just difficult,  a lot of times it was two guys in the ball but it didn't matter, so he was just making those shots. So uh, you know the bottom line, we did complete. We - we played great, you know, and we were very close to - to win that game. I mean - Um, I guess, yeah, now we have really important game in Portland, uh you know, uh we know what we need to do to beat those guys, so uh, we gotta get some rest tomorrow. For sure we're gonna watch some film in practice and uh, every game matters now especially against those teams who are also competing and same - who are in the same position of fighting for a playoff so uh, I think we'll be fine you know, we - we need to finish uh, well this - this trip now and uh, starting for next game. Yeah, yeah uh, that game in LA was huge for us and I think uh, that's one of the reasons why we play well tonight. Uh, you know, obviously we - we all need to step up defensively because we were struggling all this season uh, defensively, so uh, right now you know we're watching a lot of film. Um, offensively I'm doing some different things. Right now, you know, I'm playing it the three sometimes with AD and uh Julius, so there is like we're all kind of trying to figure out, you know, how we can be the best uh, but I think, you know, we're gonna find a way and uh, last year at the end of the season, you know, we had a great uh, ten - ten wins, you know uh, so hopefully we can do the same this year and uh, right now you know, I think uh, if we continue you know, working the same way we're doing right now, we're gonna be fine. It's very very hard. He's probably the best shooter right now in history basketball and uh, like I said before, a lot of times we were doubling him, we were like two guys on the ball, you know, AD it's - it's huge guy but doesn't matter. You know, he was in his zone and uh, you know it was just like after the dribble, catch and shoot, like long shots, there was nothing we can do but um, you know and we tried him to pass the ball but he wanted to shoot, he was just hot and uh, he did what he need to do so, you know, it was great performance by - by him and uh, you know uh, we gonna now go and do our stuff. Thank you guys.",0
"[inaudible] For sure, uh, and I think especially that the second unit, you know, uh, with me there, this team kneed, you know, needs support, needs to - need for the second unit to be - to be better. And uh, you know, this group has been, you know - like we didn't be toghether, just for a little bit, so uh, right now, everybody being healthy, you know, I feel like uh, we're going to step up. It's about - it's about time to step up. Uh, we played great that game in uh - in LA when we won, uh, we also played great in - in San Francisco, but that third quarter when Steph got hot, you know, it was - it was just difficult, but um, we will be fine, you know, we know really well this team tonight, uh, we need to play some good defense and offensively, you know, do what we been doing last few games. Well, there is a few more things, you know, that we - we need to get better. Uh, obviously, I think that, you know, start of the games, we need to start with more energy, with more urgency, more effort, and uh, you know, closing better the games. I think that's the one issue that we - we have during this year, and uh, we're trying to fix that so uh, we just need to play with energy. When we play uh, defense with energy, our offense is also better, so that's the, you know, that's our mindset right now, to - to be better defensively and improve those - improve those numbers. [inaudible] Go ahead. I think, especially this year, you know, our offensive was not uh, the issue, our defense was the issue because there was a lot of games that we scored over a hundred twenty points, but we lost the games. So uh, it - it's - it's the defense, you know, when we - when we win those first quarters, most of the times we win the games because we set a tone from the beginning. We play, you know, harder than other teams so uh, that's - that's what we need to do, you know, we need to start well the games and uh, it has to be defense, you know, we need to take a pride of defense and uh, trust each other, have better communication, and uh, lately we been watching lot of film, uh, so I think uh, our defense is improving. So uh, now, you know, especially this part of the season, it's when we need to start winning, and uh, I'm sure, you know, uh, it's - it's a good time with a year for tonight, you know, to start winning and get some good uh - good streak.",3
"Yeah. I feel great. First of all, the most important, I feel very comfortable with the teammates, uh with the coaching staff. They've been great to me so far. Everybody, you know, uh with some warm welcome. Helping me, you know, to - to adjust as soon as possible. And uh, today, we did some extra work because I need it after I was out for more - more than two weeks and a half with my calf. And uh, each day, I feel better, you know. Basically, I'm back. I have a little bit more you know, that - a little pain in my calf, but it's - it's - it's not a big deal, you know. Uh, what then - what I want to make sure, you know, when I'm back, I'm gonna be one hundred percent ready to play. And, it's - it's all about that, and hopefully, you know, uh, we can - we can win tonight here. Well, it's - it's not simple, you know, because they call and they say like you're just traded, and pack your stuff, go get the plane, and you're just moving, you know. It's not just you, it's your whole family as well, so - but the - the good thing, it's very, you know, I did it last year as well, when I got traded from Chicago to Pelicans and uh, it - it was not that hard uh, really. You know, it's all about team organization, the way they're treating you, helping you, and - and so far, you know, everybody was great, you know. They're making it as smooth as possible and uh, for me, this is blessing, you know, to be part of this special team. I think everybody - everybody wants that, so uh, I'm more than happy and uh, I just, you know, want to enjoy, you know, this moment, because this is unique opportunity uh, this team wants something special and uh, you know, to be part of that, is something incredible so, you know, I - I feel very good about it. Yeah. Yeah. I - I wanted to play the last game as well, uh, the Orlando game, but they - they just want to make sure I'm - I'm feeling good, you know, a hundred percent. And uh, you know, there's a lot of good memories here in Chicago, in this building, you know, the first game, uh playoffs games and uh, so it was really good home for me for those three years and half I spent here and uh, I wanted to play them. I - I didn't play yet this - any - any game here, at United Center, after I was traded, uh, we played at Chicago when I was with Pelicans, but it's gonna be another chance because we play, I think in twenty fifth, so I'm gonna just look forward for - for that game, it's in my notes, so. Uh, but the biggest thing for tonight, it's just uh, enjoy be with the team, you know, uh get better [inaudible] my teammates, and uh, win this game because we - we gonna need all those - all those wins. They're amazing. Uh, the organization's great, you know, especially those training staff guys uh, they've been really taking care of me uh, we did a lot of stuff, you know, just to, you know - to - to have some baseline of my -my calf, and uh, it's a good thing, you know, nobody wants to rush. They, you know, sometimes when you got traded they want you to play right away, but, you know, they - they know it's gonna be a long season, you know, it's All Star break is also coming, so it's kinda good moment for me to - to get healthy and get stronger. Yeah. I think this is perfect - it's gonna be perfect fit for me, the way those guys play, there on the floor. There's a lot of freedom uh, they play fast uh, with Giannis, you know, who is - who is bringing all this attention on him, you know, going to the basket so, I think it's gonna be really good having somebody who can shoot the threes, you know, space the floor, so I think it's gonna be great for me - I'm the guy. So, that's what I been doing all my life, you know, so uh, and as well, like uh, whatever they gonna need, you know, depends. But uh, there is much more of me than just a shooter, you know, this -  this year and last year's been great year for me defensively, uh, rebounding the ball, so I'm just, you know, proving myself. And uh, right now, I'm kinda - when I get back, I'm gonna be fresh, I'm gonna be with a lot of energy, you know, a lot of emotions as well. So uh, just, you know, when I'm on the floor, I'm gonna, you know, play hard, play simple as well. And uh, you know, try to - to do my best job, and all that trust they put in me, so I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna be able to - to put on the floor. Is Brook being extra nice? Robin. Thank you.",2
"Yeah, uh when I see - when I think about it, it's a - it's a lot, but it's a lot good things, you know? Uh, you know, always when you get traded, it's some uh, new, fresh start, uh, you always are excited you know, pumped up, you want to do your best, but uh, I said this before, you know, I'm gonna say it again, you know, uh, you know, it's just - it was - this moment was great for me you know, to be traded here, it was - it was a blessing, uh because sometimes you can win, you can lose with a trade, but in this case, you know, I think it was a win for me. I always want to be the part of the winning team, and uh, I just, you know - I know it's a important season for me, for the team you know, uh, we are all looking for something special, so uh, I just want to uh, do my best, you know. And uh, right now, I'm - I'm happy, I'm very confident uh, the team is playing well, and I'm trying to, you know, to be the important piece. Yeah. Well uh, there's a lot of guys - they're not - they're not playing right now, they're out, and they have young players who are really stepping up - Kenrich Williams uh, you know, Frank Jackson. Uh, really good team uh, playing with a lot of - a lot of freedom, uh, you know, uh, obviously, great big guys AD and uh Jahlil have been playing great, so um, they don't have nothing to lose. They just gonna play free uh, play hard, you know, the biggest thing, you know, we need to set a tone from the beginning, because uh, all those game, it matter to us more than to them, so, what we need to do is we need to win you know, but to win, we need to play better defense than last game.",0
"Uh, we just had to grind, you know, we had to make, you know, a couple - a good stop amount of runs and stops and, you know, just to give ourself confidence you know, kinda got on couple guys during halftime to get going, and you know guys squandered really well so um, but we - we didn't do enough, you know, we didn't - we didn't string enough stops together that, you know it's able to get the win, so it's a couple key plays that kinda hurt us, and you know, we just had to get, you know rebounds, and couple - couple big plays as far as like threes and stuff so, you know that's what hurt us at the end then, you know, free throws played another big part in that too. Uh, our approach a little bit. Um, you know, we we was feeling the game out a little bit, um, kind of easing our way into it rather than coming out with the response that we needed in that third quarter, so, that's what allowed us, you know, to get that deep in that hole and then, you know, try to fight back fight back, you know, we didn't - our everything wasn't together the same way. So we just kinda, you know, regrouped at second half, and we was able to come back and respond, and we do what a put ourself in a good position to win. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's the first - that's the first I've seen him act that way, um, and seeing him you know, certain cases that, you know, he get emotional, but that was probably the most - yeah that was the most, I'm sorry that I've ever seen him. I mean, that second - that second half he was a - he sparked that second half pretty much, cause of how he came into the second half, um, in the locker room during that halftime, you know, he just put a fire under people's ass and you see we was able to respond pretty well. We put ourself in great position, but, you know, we just didn't do it have enough to you know sustain. Yeah. Does it - We've shown tonight, you know, um, Ryan got - Ryan got on Wigs, you know, to start the fourth, the third quarter, um, challenged him about giving us a little more, um and Ryan - he responded He responded very well and, you know, we was building that confidence in him as well that kept putting him in psitions to, you know, keep being successful and, you know, keep, you know, going and, you know, our encouragement is what allowed him to, you know, keep it - keep it going in that second half and, you know, him and KAT, you know, kind of carried us, and you know, but we just gotta do it - a better job as a team of giving them a little extra as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely is. You know, like he said, you put it in the right terms. You know, Ryan came in, you know, he was definitely upset, and, like you said, we seen it and we felt it, so, you know we was able to respond in a good way.",1
"Create more stops. You know, in order for us to get out and run, we gotta be able to generate more stops that way we can, you know, get out and run, you know, we don't want to sit up here and take the ball out every time. We sit up here and you can't generate because it allows defense to set. I mean we just knocking out day by day, nobody's in a real funk or anything, it's just, you know, tryna figure out things um, you know, get out of, you know, this - this uncomfortable feeling of, you know, being in that - back into that - that [inaudible] the stretch, but guys is not, you know, heads not down, like we're just set up here tryna figure out ways to, you know, get it in. You know, we gotta do a little bit different um, as far as like what our approach a little bit but, as far as like the way we're handling day by day, you know, we're still approaching the same way, we just, you know, adding a little bit different every day. I said that last night, you know, it put a spark - it's put a spark in us and we was able to come out and respond in the second half, and, you know, we didn't - unfortunately we didn't do enough to, you know, sustain it but, you know, it was a couple key plays but, overall, that's what allowed us to get out in that jump. We just gotta - we just don't need to sit up here at half, to have someone put that in us. You know, we just gotta have that from the very beginning um, you know I think Ryan kind of got away - got to us a little bit, on that - during that - that halftime speech, um but, you know overall we just gotta come out with that same fire from the very beginning. No, no. No. No it don't - it doesn't feel like that, you know, you know it is - it is rough but, you know, necessarily we just, you know, attack each day differently, you know. We come in, we put our minds to - to work, we put our bodies to work, you know, we got guys over there working now that, you know, just, you know, overall we just gotta sit up here and like, you know, do little things and, you know, we gotta put a bigger emphasis on it and, you know once you - once you put the time in, put the work in, like it'll all - speak for itself. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Guys gotta step up. That's nothing else to be - kinda be explained, like we can't just rely on them two, we gotta be able to help them. Uh, yes and no. Lot of different - KAT does a lot of different things that other guys can't do so then other guys, do things that KAT can't do, so it's not a - a - a matter of guys stepping up and trying to match that caliber, it's about complementing each other so, you know, just as a team like everybody doesn't - isn't gonna be able to - to fill each other's void, you know, but you also have - you also have to have that mindset - not to have the mindset, but, you know, do the little things that, you know, help - help each other out, you know, in different phase of the game, so you know, that's the aspect of where we are as a unit so.",0
"Uh, they're very good team, very seasoned team um, have a lot of veterans, you know, with Kawhi and PG leading the -  leading the way and you know, their second unit has been very well - very good this year so, you know, they - they played a overall good game and, you know, we just had to sit up here and put ourself in a better position. Because we had too many turnovers. That was - that's what lead them, you know, to get out of transition and run, you know um, you know that's what uh, we talked about, you know, after the game. In order for us to, you know, have them fast break points, you know, down we gotta take better care of the ball but it was a lot, of you, know broken plays and a lot of, you know, different things that played a part in it, so we just got to be more mindful in taking care of the ball. Trying. Trying to stay - stay positive, you know it's definitely frustrating but, you know, we can't let that little bit creep in, you know, we still have to go in, we still got to go out there and play, and it - it's tough, you know, we're a - we're a young team but, you know, with guys like, you know, me, Wigs, and, you know, KAT leading the way, you know, Shabazz has done a great job of talking with guys just keeping everyone together and, you know, being, you know, cohesive with everyone so, you know, it's very - it's very, you know, frustrating but - Absolutely, absolutely. You know it starts with us because we the ones out there playing, everything can't come from the coaches so, you know, we just have to continue to, you know, do the little things and we have to do little things for longer periods of time throughout the game. We's - we's with it for a good stretch but it was just little things that, you know, kind of late - allowed the game to get away from us. Learning how to - learning how to manage success, um, better um, we - like I said, that's one thing we talked about um, we can't get comfortable, you know, with how we started because we play a full eighty two game year um, and, you know, just overall, like you gotta - like you said, they - they is part of building [inaudible] habits so, you know, we just got to continue to, you know, keep, you know, knocking days out and keep doing, you know, the little things because if we keep doing, you know, like keep, you know - staying strong with it, we will be able to, you know, come out and [inaudible] and turn this thing around. Of course. You know, of course you want your teammate to make it, but, you know, we not focused - we not focused on All Star, we focused on, you know, winning games and [inaudible], you know, changing the little things around here, you know that's the main focus that everyone is - kind of been, you know, doing it, just, you know, that's the last - one of the last things that we've been worried about but, you know, we just gotta fix the little things, each day in day out and, you know, we gotta change this team to where we can get wins.",1
"Uh, it tells a lot, you know, just being able to come in and, you know, you know be a major impact um, you know just shows that, you know, my teach, my coach believe in, so, when you come in and play how I play, you know, my team is just, you know, put me in the right position and uh, you know, I just do what I was told to do. So, you know, just, you know, getting feel for it and us coming out with a win, you know, on the first time, I feel good. Realistically, this morning. I got here at, wanna say, twelve thirty. Yeah twelve thirty pretty much, um I flew to Houston yesterday uh, early six - six o'clock in the morning, had to do all my tests and then I was on [inaudible], the last flight out that night, so when I got here, you know, just went - went to the hotel, got something to eat and went right to sleep, cause it was uh, it was a quick quick turnaround from this, so, I literally had like four hours to pack, so, I just had to do what I had to do. Absolutely, that's what I am here for. You know being able to be that, you know, the line up that we have, you know - we - I'm able to, you know, add lot of versatility, you know - add more versatility, you know, guys can do a lot in this team, but, you know, me at being the, you know, elite defender that I've been - I've been accustomed to being, you know, adding the value to this team and, you know, just based on before, that just shows that, you know, we can do a lot, we can be very very, you know, good at it, so  - you know, we just gotta keep building, I gotta keep learning the system that way, you know I can keep, you know, being - get even better, you know, because it is a [inaudible], you know, I was just out there, pretty much playing, and you know, my teammates just talking to - talking me through a lot of things so, you know it's a couple plays wher they was like, man if you could do that, if you continue to do that, like man, there's gonna be a lot of different things that you gotta - we ain't gotta do, so, but, you know, my teammates are just, you know, put me in the right position and like I said, I just did what I was told to do and what I was asked to do, so that was it. The - on the defense. Defensive end, you know, with me getting through a couple screens um, you know, being aggressive, you know uh, just overall how I was playing and my - my uh, defensive mentality, you know, just little things, you know, my - my structure and everything, of how um, like I said, of how agressive I was and guys, and you know, not letting them, you know, push me around [inaudible] thing, you know, like I said guarding AD and Bron, you know throughout the game, you know, guys, you know we had a - we had a good overall scheme on them, and lot of different guys, you know, put themselves in great position, you know, with them and we did. Came out with the win. I mean, we got a win with it. You know tonight was uh, you know, first time with it uh, me being, you know, in that role, but, you know, overall, it can be very well, it can be very good because, like you said, you know, you space the floor and it put a lot of guys in and, you know, different positions and it's - it's a lot - a lot of guys that, you know, are big man that protect the rim, it takes them away from that, so it just puts them in a lot of scramble situations, that's not a lot of bigs that are used to it so. And they're not used to guarding guys on the perimeter too as well so, you know, that's a big advantage to us, you know, we just gotta keep getting better at it. I knew about it already. So, I mean I was kind of preparing for it, but it just went officially, you know um, it was [inaudible] to the other team, you know, so somebody dropped the ball a little bit but, you know. You know they put a - put a little [inaudible] in my ear, and, like you said, they was like, you know, just be prepared for when it hits - when it hits for everyone, so I just, you know, take it as is. He just asked me that question. Yeah.",2
"Uh it's been realy good um, you know, getting used to the system, you know, getting used to playing style um, still getting comfortable with everything, but, you know, I feel very confident and, you know, I've been playing really well, over the past couple games so, I'm just taking my fuel and everything, you know, just, you know, happy to be in - be in the system now. Hey, Kev's a crazy dude. Um, told a lot of crazy stories uh, but overall he did -  he did help me a lot, you know, one of them guys, you know, just taught me a lot and helped me get a better understanding of the game, you know, he's been around for a long time and, you know, he's been very successful so, you know, just ultimately, you know, having that time with him, you know, just growing as a player, you know, I got to - I got to learn a lot of knowledge from him, you know, a lot of guys that, you know, really helped me get a understanding of it, so overall that year was very big for me. Just the fundamentals, um, you know, with the offense, you know, shots, you know, volume, uh, knowledge, different things, you know, it was so much that he played a part in that, you know, I - gave me a better feel for the game. Oh yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. You know of course, I was actually watching yesterday that they played and I was like man I - I got to catch a game, just catch up with him, but I definitely will be able to do that so. Man, it's very - very - it's very, you know, [inaudible], you know, like you said, you know, being in system that, you know, you don't have to do as much, you know, the focus is a lot more on James and Russ. You know we just got to be ready, to you know, you know, guys, you know, pass us the ball, and you know uh, [inaudible] find us in open transition and stuff and knock down open shots, you know they do - they have a lot of load on them already, so you know, we just got to get there and support them and, you know, them guys, you know, have done a great job of finding us in different situations and, you know, we just got to just stay locked in, we gotta get them shots up and, you know, we gotta be locked in from very beginning. I'mma guard, from smallest to biggest guys, you know, don't - don't even matter what we play, so y'all gonna see a lot of different lineups, lotta different match ups, um and overall, just got to continue to - just gotta watch the film on different guys, you know, throughout the game and can't just specifically focus on just one person. I've done - that's how - that's what made me who I - I am. You know, I've guarded, you know, one through five at some point in my career so now, to do it on a nightly basis, you know, there's a lot of people that aren't accustomed to it.",0
"Uh, I'm getting better and better um, everyday, you know, just, you know, trying to get accustomed to the way - the style of play, you know, it's very simple for me, you know, they want me to knock down open shots, you know, guard, and do what I do, you know, and, you know, just get a good - good feel, and they say, you know, a lot of tension gonna be on James and Russ so, you know, you just gotta put them in, you know, best position, and then we gotta put ourself in the best position, including [inaudible] off the ball, we got to set up and be able to, you know - they got - they trust us not hitting open shots [inaudible]. It allows us to [inaudible] be disruptive on a lot of different phases on the court, because, like you said, when we guarding [inaudible] the ball, you can put anybody on it, you got, like I said, you got tough, you know House and all them other other guys that step here and do - very versatile - very versatile, so you know, just overall, [inaudible] putting different people in different matchups and put a lot of uh - defenders in front of ball handlers so, so it's not just [inaudible] guy so. It's very fun - very fun, less - less I gotta do you know, you know, but I put a lot of, you know, emphasis on making sure that I - I do little things just to make sure that, you know, I'm able to hold myself accountable, just the way they hold theirself accountable and like you said they - they have a lot of, you know, trust in me, so, you know I can't - I don't want to let them guys down, you know this system I'm very familiar with, so I just gotta [inaudible] keep doing what I've been doing.",1
"Felt great uh like you said wanna take, take a little bit time off just to make sure everything was good. Um showed tonight didn't feel any pain. So uh continue to trust my staff trust uh trust uh the guys in the back to do all the dirty work for us and um make sure I'm ready to go on Friday. I mean um to me I just lived by if it isn't broke then you could still go out there and play you know. So um uh that's just what I've been living by ever since I was in I was a kid and I've always wanted to play. So um nothing's gonna stop me from playing but uh just listening to the training staff and listening to Fizz and some of the guys - my pops. Just wanted to make sure it was the right decision for me to sit down especially after back-to-back and uh I did that",1
How those guys can just come in here and do what they want. That shouldn't happen. Um can't happen. Um that's all I can say. I can't do nothing but come back in the next day and work and look at your mistakes. But there's so many we can so many times we can say that. You know um we're 30-plus games in. And we gotta hold ourselves accountable. Um um I mean if it wasn't for Kevin Knox in the first half I mean they scored 60 points there in the first half so they still had a great offensive offensive half you know going into the halftime. So um we gotta get better in that in that um on that end the floor and um we're scoring. It's just got put a string of stops together in order for us to get wins.,1
"Yeah uh I think it was just more so of us um just taking what the defense gives us. And Pushing the pace um and being unselfish out there uh a lot of the shots we were taking were wide open and that came with ball movement. And uh again defensive stops and uh running [inaudible] fast break opportunities. Yeah they're talent they're talented ball players and what Trey already knew, he was gonna come in and and give us everything you know he he he stays working. And Mario is just a motor in itself so uh just having those guys out there competing on both ends of the floor and giving em an opportinity helped us tremendously. Um it makes us a little bit more confident, you know going into our next ballgame um but we're going to enjoy this one. Um see what we can do, get better at uh moving forward and and uh try to run with the momentum. Oh oh, happy birthday Mom. Sorry.",2
Know where my shots are gonna come from now. So um you know I'm happy. Uh played hard. I played aggressive and uh that's all I can ask for. Oh you know I think just being an energy guy like I did today diving on the floor uh um just making it disrupt disruptive it on defensive end. And and uh yeah I know the shots are gonna come. You know Luka attracts a lot of uh a lot of attention out there so um it's my job just to knock down the shots he makes it easy for us. Uh continue to play this type of defense we played today. And uh trust one another out there on the floor. Um it's gonna be some new faces so um you know we just got to make sure we welcome everybody. Uh and we're all in this together. It's great you know it's great. And um he makes you want to go out there and you know play harder and uh and um actually wanna go out there and just compete man. Uh he makes your life a lot easier out there on the floor and you know what more can you ask,2
"He missed those two free throws man, I know if he made those two. He's gonna walk into the locker room right now really mad at himself about that. But uh, but uh you know it was a great win. Uh you know he went out here and balled out and um he'll get it the next game. Uh I mean I was just taking what the defense was giving me. Uh I know a couple of those shots I want back. Give my teammates the ball. But uh all in all I just wanted to stay aggressive and uh you know lead the spark in this win. Uh no. No pressure. Just wanted to go out here and attack like I said and uh and uh just be a leader out there while he was uh sitting out. Thank you. Appreciate it",3
"Huge I mean uh it's been something that we've been saying uh throughout this whole little process. But um at the end of the day, we came out and we did we needed do the secure a victory. Um you know the first quarter wasn't wasn't our best but uh with that being said second third quarter I thought we did a pretty good job defensively of holding and just going out there and and scoring and just uh playing our game so it was good to get back to that. Um just playing with a better pace. Uh we we came out we played uh you know, we were getting up and down the floor, We were using our defense to fuel our offense. Uh with that being said too, you know we saw the ball go in the basket, we were able to make shots, get into the lane. Um and that was big for us. So you know uh we gotta bring that into tomorrow's game. That's huge I mean um you know even for the second unit that comes in um it picks up their intensity, their pace um and you know it gives us a little bit of relief. You know and those guys have come in and play some big roles for us. Just gotta um embrace that opportunity. Embrace that um that challenge. And he's right. And you know, we gotta come out every night and and really uh you know be the best that we can be out there. Yeah and um you know even he played a great great game tonight. You know not just with his three point shooting, but with uh his defense intensity too. You know he was able to get uh you know a lot of stops for us. Some steals and we was able to run off that. But his shooting, we know he's a shooter. He's a professional shooter. You know I go against him in practice and shooter drills and he's a professional shooter. So uh you know it's great to see those shots fall and especially in the game like today that we needed. Yeah we just really honestly started playing defense you know. You know what I mean. Sounds like a joke but it's not you know first quarter we just were really weren't locked in. Uh they were getting a lot of kick out threes and we knew coming into the game that was a team that you know wanted to shoot a lot of threes and make threes so I think they were third in the league with threes. So we had to close out to them. Really get them off the line and and scramble that's what we really did was scramble and ran around the court. Alright no problem",2
"It's frustrating. I just couldn't get in a rhythm basically. You know and uh it wasn't nothing they did. I just couldn't get in a rhythm. That was it. I seen fast break got kicked ahead. Uh you know Reggie went to the basket. I wasn't able to get the rebound. Uh that's it. Uh you know he went up for the layup um [inaudible] shoulda got the rebound. Didn't get it. Did uh, Reggie said that he felt like it got him across the arm I don't know if you had a chance to see it again. Defensively how tough is it to you know to close out on you know, it's not just you know a couple of guys that can shoot it well from deep but they have you know their bigs that can step out and hit it from from long range. Nah I don't have any any extra the pressure on. I just um just go out there try to get in the rhythm and play offensive like I've been doing. Obviously tonight wasn't able to do that. But um there's no added pressure of going to score more, I mean, the opportunities are there for me you know. When I'm open I gotta get the rock and be able to produce from there. Um you know I'm not a guy who needs X amount of play calls. You know just playing the flow. Once we're up and down and running. Um you know if I get open looks I get open looks and just gotta capitalize off that.",0
"I don't know I mean [inaudible] Oh they forced us to take a lot of um contested twos. Um you know [inaudible]. I mean shot blocker guy. He contests. So, they forced us to take a lot of those contested two type shots so that um obviously it's not the highest percentage shot. Um and we you know we weren't able to really knock down the three ball as we have shown in the past. So yeah I mean they kinda limited, you know when you when you're not making the threes and you're not really getting to the basket like that, you're shooting those twos, you know that's kinda going right into their hand pretty much. Yeah without a doubt. I mean, we're at home number one. Um and we're playing teams that we that we expect to come in and win. Um and no disrespect to the teams but you know these are games that we look on the schedule and say we need to get this win. This is one we gotta grab. You know when you look at the home schedule and you know pretty the majority of a lot of those games you say ok we're gonna grab those. But we haven't been able to. I mean it's frustrating. High. I mean, I mean obviously we gonna be frustrated. [inaudible]. I mean it's frustrating especially like I just said like being at homes versus teams that um you know we should've been able to come in and take care of business.",0
"Yeah. Nah I mean, it was part of the game. Uh for me it was uh a bit unexpected because of the timing of it. But uh you know I'm happy to be here and I'm I'm ready to embrace the challenge and just get out here and play. And uh you know do what I do and help this team win. So that's what I'm looking forward to. Yeah really excited team. Obviously you know have some great players that have come through here and have played. Um it's a team with a lot of talent. You know, a big city um you know big market. A team that's gonna put the best product on the floor, try to win games. And um you know obviously it's a historic franchise just in terms of the city and atmosphere. So uh I'm excited. Just come in and play my game um. You know obviously uh I'm all forward type player. I play both positions three four. Um I can stretch the floor shooting the three ball. Uh score um and [inaudible] my game and just playing good basketball. Playing team basketball um embracing my teammates and um you know trying to do whatever I can to win. I'm a winner and I wanna go out and um you know do the best I can to help this team. Either one. Um you know it's all um the three the four position now is pretty much uh like the same thing. So a lot of times it's predicated on the matchups that you're playing against. So uh for me, either position. I think I could offensively, I know I can you know get to my spots and create plays. Uh defensively you play gets different types of guys different matchups. Um but you know either or I like to play em. Uh yeah a little bit. I think you know West Coast uh like a lot of West Coast teams more up and down. So when I gotta speak to coach, that was something that he emphasized like wanna run more. And get out in transition just play free. So you know that's my game and um yeah I'm I'm happy to be that. Oh well actually I was facetiming my mom and we was we were talking about my little brother and my sister because they both play play in college and you know she was talking about how they they weren't playing that much and then she said well what's up with you guys and the Pistons. I said well I don't know ma but I think a trade's about to happen or something. I just said it because I saw some [inaudible]. And she was just like you know my mom been through two trades with me already and she was like well if you need me I'll come and pack, you know what I mean so. And legit, I'm on the facetime with her she's telling me some story and um I was getting a call. I said I said oh hold up, I'm about to get traded. And she said no no I got to tell you story I said no no Ma, I gotta take this call. and then I took the call and then I called her back and was like yeah I just got traded. And she said alright boy let's go. Like that's how my mom is. She's just was just let's go. Um we're going to LA let's do it. Yeah she coming, like she gonna to go to my place in Detroit and and pack it all up and get it ready. Lisa, yeah Not much. You know one thing you know about Boban is he's a great guy. Uh great charisma to him and uh he always is is dancing so then I had to show him a couple to get his flow right and you know now. You know he's a, Boban one of my best friends so even when I heard uh the trade and I got word that Boban and Avery was was coming also, you know that made it better. I've been in um, last trade I had, it was just me so it's good to have two familiar faces with me here. Uh as a as a, we honestly been playing AAU from a young age like really young. Like I wanna say, I remember playing, seeing him play like AAU nationals like ten and under and eleven and under you know. So um at that age he was getting the baskets. You know he was out there balling. Um they probably had a bunch of ringers on their team anyway at that point. But as we got older up, then you know my team, my team, you know we would get in the business, yeah.",2
"Nah I felt great. Um you know I'm obviously happy I was excited just to get there with the with my new teammates. And um you know it felt good to just just go out and play. Um obviously I'll be a little bit more acclimated coming up. Been tough to sleep at night sometimes, you know just with the time change. So when I'm able to fully get my eight to ten hours, I'll be even even more prepared and better. But um you know I felt good getting out there and just playing. Yeah I mean I think um you know if you look around the league now, that's the name of the game is having dual forwards who can play different positions and and feed off each other. Um I play with a with I got Marcus Morris who was able to you know be able to create mismatches so I kinda have a good feel for that. And you know I think we we really complement each other well out there. Yeah I mean uh it made it easier for me. Just getting stops and going and getting out and running. And I thought we did a good job of getting out on transition at times and getting to the free-throw line and baskets. Um and then offensively, obviously we put a couple of sets in. Um you know I'm not memorizing all the sets yet but we're just playing. We're gonna play off each other and uh create some good reads and just uh play basketball. Yeah I I felt a little bit of freedom. Obviously uh we got some good spacing with some good shooters. Um DeAndre creates a lot of attention uh especially at the basket so I definitely saw myself with a with a couple of drives and some open lanes that uh I haven't been that used to. But um you know I think this is a good mix of guys on the team who who know how to play know how to move without the ball, know how to create plays so uh it makes my job a little bit easier. Just taking the next step. I thought tonight uh you know we still need to do a little bit better job of closing out. Uh especially when we got the lead we kind of let them slip back in. Uh you know so we just got to impose our will a little bit more. Uh clean up some things defensively that I think could help us. But you know like I said we uh just kind of got it together but we're expecting good things and we have to really be locked in and ready for the next and just being able to grow and get better. I know a lot of the, I know offense. I know how to play good ball. So and that's what doc wants us to do so obviously I don't know you know all the sets. We put a couple in uh but uh you know when it comes down it, it's basketball. Just just playing off each other playing off reads. Yeah Me. Some people don't know that. They was surprised I was in it. I'm like how you surprised so you gotta check the numbers so. But uh nah it's a it's a blessing to be in it with those guys. If you look down it's not it's not many forwards so I I'm I think I'm like the only forward I mean Paul George two guard, small forward but um so it's gonna be a lot of fun a different type of shooting so I'm practicing a little bit upcoming and upcoming weekend and get ready to win.",2
"Um, you know uh, we knew they were a team that makes runs and gets back into the game. So, we just had to pick up our defensive intensity and get multiple stops uh. And I thought for us, we we battled all night; we got big efforts. Uh [inaudible] came in, played great for us. Uh and we just uh continued to fight even if some of the shots that we normally have fall didn't fall for us so that was a good effort from us. Yeah I mean, you know I'm open [inaudible]. I'm ready uh, you know all throughout the game so just gotta do whatever I can to help our team. Well everybody's uh, everybody's close at this point. Uh you know especially in the West coast so, everybody uh is gonna be uh [inaudible]. I mean um, we knew they were a team that makes runs, so uh just to keep the pressure on em all, all night. And uh, keep em playing hard. That was the biggest thing for us. And uh we had some shots that could've fell, didn't fall. But, we we use our defense to get get, us, you know, to keep that pressure up. Uh, nah I think we still got a long way to go. I mean I think uh we still have to uh do do a couple things better tonight. I felt like we could've been better on the second chance opportunities and turnovers. But once we uh just slow ourselves down and and get back and running, we good. Yeah, ball movement was really good today. I mean uh, uh you know I thought we kept on moving it all night and got some good looks.",1
"Clearly. Yeah, I mean uh, I give em credit. They came in here and um, they played a great [inaudible] of basketball and um, they got what they wanted all night. Uh, uh they, they're a unique team because they're young and they get up and down and they got a lot of shooting on the floor. So they put kinda uh, put us in different positions and uh they made, they made shots all night so. It was a tough, tough night for us all around, but you know, as as you said, um you can't walk into games. And they're they're team that's better than the record presents I mean, um, they're in a lot of games and they played tough tonight. And, and you know give em credit they they they out-did us tonight. No I mean um, it was another night for us. Another game. We got to be prepared and ready. It's the NBA and um that's a part of a long season. and um you know it's easy to say that now, but at the same time um, we go out there, we play. They lace up their shoes just like us. Well, hopefully it does help us, I mean, It'd be good to get in the gym together. Get some uh added reps. Uh adjust on some things that we can get better at from uh, this, this this uh couple games that we seen. And um, especially for tonight too, a couple things we can tune up on and get ready for our next game. Oh yeah, he's been playing great. Um, you know he's kind of like the guy on the team that that falls under the radar a lot. But his play has been tremendous for us. Uh, tonight ten rebounds. The other night, you know assists and rebounds too and high numbers. So he's been aggressive for us and he's been a guy that space on the floor and shooting well. And just goes out there and does all the little things for the team. Um, you know he's a voice of the team, just by his presence, and uh you know he's played well since uh, entering the starting lineup.",1
"Just was uh evaluating the defense and what was there. Um, you know, we knew they had uh a size different or some difference on some of the matchups. So, we was able to uh get some good uh. Good actions there and in different positions to get us going. But uh overall it was a good fourth quarter for us. Yeah a hundred percent I mean uh, we're getting there uh. You know obviously there's still time, uh and there's still things that we gotta work on, but there's some really good sports out there on the floor with us playing the right way. Uh you know I think in the first half I think we had, ah what was it, like 21 assists or something like that. So, yes that was impressive. So, those are the things that we can continue to get better at and um and to grow off of. But uh especially not having both our big guys [inaudible] game for us. Yeah I mean uh, you know it's tough with them cuz they have a great guard who gets in the middle of the lane and uh, Steven Adams, we were kinda uh, battling his strength and size. And they were able to make some threes in that process too. So, uh I thought we kinda, there were a couple plays there in the fourth quarter that we coulda made, made the more simple play, and we woulda been fine with. But, I think as a new team, we're just trying to all feel each other out. And making extra passes and sometimes tonight I thought we shoulda just uh, you know went, went for the easier play. Butyou know, it's not a bad thing.",1
"Yeah I mean uh, you know I, I like it here. Uh, it's been a good start that we've been able to have. Uh, good group of guys and a team has a lot of potential. So um, you know, coach has been great for me. Uh as we come in play my game. Uh, he's a great coach in terms of uh offensive offensive mind of how to play. Uh, defensively how to get us going too. So, you know um he's a great coach to be around so I I'm happy",2
"Just, we were too lazy. All night. Communication, lazy with our coverages and um, second was [inaudible] whole game [inaudible]. Um, yeah I mean, that's where where it starts you know I think [inaudible] I mean um, I give them credit too they, they made a lot of tough shots. Uh, but at the end of the day it wasn't to our standard with how we wanna play and uh in terms of defending the three, uh we getting out the shooters but they're a team that has a lot of versatile guys that can shoot the three from many different positions. So, to put us [inaudible] in different coverages that I think we weren't really used to. But regardless of that, I mean I just thought we didn't we didn't bring it tonight [inaudible] win a game. Uh I don't know I mean I wish I knew why we didn't bring it but I knew, you know I said, you know like I told you guys but just that team is better than what they record represents. I played in LA, they came to LA, they whooped up us in LA. You know, I mean  they're a young team, up and coming. Um Played with great pace you know [inaudible] those guys didn't really know their games now they have established games, so they're a good team, I mean, so I don't know why, but they came out, and they played, they played one of their best games and um they've been playing really good basketball since the all-star break so, it's a disappointing loss for us. I don't know. I mean, you know we got some good looks that we uh could've converted. They didn't go down and it's just how it goes a little bit but uh. You know it was, it could've just been part of it. Maybe a couple looks didn't go our way. Yeah I mean, the kid's really good. Um you know I like guys who come in and find they rhythm in the league I mean, he started out early, but it took him a little while to get going. But he's a guy who's playing. He's a you know, he's a guy that, a tough cover for everybody that's out there. The whole five guys on our end. So I mean, uh, that kid is good. That kid is gonna be really good. He's really good right now. I think we know we have to come all the time. Um, we know that we gotta, we just gotta be locked in. Tonight, we weren't. I don't think our, you know, our focus level was where we needed it so, you know we gotta lock in more, then. And, we gotta also see that, teams are too comfortable. We gotta hook ourselves up and that's everybody including myself and um, you know this is disappointing loss I mean, I hate to say you can, take positives from it, but imma be honest, this was a disappointing one. We gotta go onto the next game and, and be ready to bounce back.",0
"The effort was better but we still didn't get a win. So, you know we could be happy about the effort but we still didn't win so that's. Um, I definitely see an effort that was made last night. The first two games our effort wasn't existing at all. Uh but if giving effort is progress than yeah. Well we just, again we come out a little bit lax. Uh I think the first game and this game or this past game that we played, um we had leads going into the second half and we just were relaxed a little bit instead of staying hungry and you know and thirsty to you know to keep uh keeping the foot on the gas. [inaudible] We just lack effort the first three games. That's all there is to it, there's nothing more. Rashad was huge for us. Uh he played big all night. Aggressive. Uh he hit first, he took advantage of uh you know their middle like we needed him to do so he was great. I'm comfortable in my skin anywhere and everywhere. So yeah Yeah I think so. I'm a laid-back dude period. But I can be vocal if need be. So I'm a chameleon of such. I think we're at a point where we know what we have to do as a team period. And we have to continue to keep each other accountable and continue to go out and and execute our game plan. It's playing with more energy. That's all. Playing with more energy and being more assertive yes. I'm sorry? Yeah, we can game plan for them we can game plan for everybody in the league but with teams like ourselves with you know talent down the board, we have to focus on what we do and what we do well. We have to create an identity for ourselves and that's it man.",1
"Uh, I think it was important for us to get a win. Uh it wasn't pretty; a lot of mistakes. Came out sluggish but we we figured it out. We settled into the game and we got a win. Just taking it one possession at a time. Staying poised, getting stops. Uh communicating. Uh we just stayed the course of the game. Uh we know that that's the team that gets up big and loses leads as well, so we would just continue to execute our game plan, continue to stay with it, uh continue to chip away bit by bit and not try to go for the home run hit. Just stay with it. Stick to your principles. Trust your teaching. That's about it. One win can't cure uh the things that you struggle with. It's just about continuing to stay consistent continuing to work every day on the things that you uh aren't that good at and just try to get better as a team. He was really aggressive last night. He took charge and took control of the game. And in order for this team to be a good team, we need that from him every night. You know, we need him to play the way he played every night. Um but he's gonna young. He's still learning. He's continuing to to get better every day and um you know I'm just looking forward to him continuing to take lead and be aggressive.",2
"How do I fill this opportunity? Uh I feel great man, I feel blessed. It's the opportunity to play the game that uh that I've been playing since a kid. A game that I love and uh I get another opportunity in a in a new city. Um, I'm just I mean I still was able to play or be around the game and teach and learn and do all those things. So uh every situation is a bless a blessed situation uh when you playing at this level. Uh four hundred fifty of the best basketball players in the world so anytime you got a roster spot you're good. Uh well I know tendencies cuz just scouting reports and all that so uh those things I'm pretty familiar with. But getting to know like like the uh like the ins and outs of each player, together, playing with them, is a little different. So I'm just trying to probably take a little while to figure that out. But um everybody's been very welcoming accommodating so I don't think it'll be long before I can figure things out. Huh, from the outside in, honestly it's just I can't figure out why they struggling or when I was on the other team couldn't figure out why the struggle was so big. But um when you really dig in and look, you just have a lot of players hurt. Uh my season so far? Uh it's just I guess just here you know this being here. I wouldn't call it great wouldn't call it terrible but it's just a season. Uh just well in Sacramento, that was part of my yeah my role is trying to help the younger guys come along that didn't have that much experience. But this is a different situation so my role would probably change again. Play defense, shoot threes. Do what I can to help his team win. That's my I guess that's my new role. Whatever, I'm happy anytime I'm on the court. So whether I'm shooting the ball, playing defense, anything I can do to help the team win that's what I try to do to the best of my abilities. So I'm not one to complain about shots not one to complain about touches or any of that. I just play. Well of course you want to start. Um and he did tell me I was coming to start. Most of my career in the NBA, I've been a starter. So that's kind of like what I'm used to. Yeah the coach told me yeah. I think so. Uh more opportunity a little bit more rhythm uh when you planing heavy minutes. So I think uh I think it will be to I guess media and fans it would be a a better opportunity or more opportunity. Uh I didn't have a reaction. Oh you know what but once I did think about it I was thinking like dang I hope nobody's still pissed at me for Yeah way back when. Nah nah. I don't know man. What I do know about the fans here is that they're very supportive and playing here, it's always been a been a tough place to play. Uh what I remember, we was getting blown out probably I think we were losing by twenty. And it was like, I think in the fourth quarter, and you know he was kind of like in front of me like uh uh what was it open court, and uh I was just trying to make a play on the ball. And unfortunately he uh he got hurt. He was pretty light I was pretty light too but I guess the momentum of you know the velocity that I bring uh kind of took him down. Hurt him. Uh I did. Right after, uh I told him I mean obviously I didn't do it on purpose it was a part of, it was a basketball play that he just, you know that went wrong. And I don't think he uh took it personal it wasn't nothing personal for me. But you know you never like to see anybody get hurt. You never like to hurt anybody. This is what we do uh for a living. This is what we do to feed our families. So it's never no uh malicious intent. Ah, switch the mentality. You kind of just get the feel of what everybody else doing when you get to that team me. Um me being a player that kind of pieces things together, I just kind of try to try to feel the the temperament of the team and get in where I fit in. It's more difficult for my family than it is for me. Uh I know what this is coming into to this game. I've been here a long time. But when you have children and they have to move from school new city new friends get out of their comfort zone it's it's that's the tough part. But, everything else is is pretty easy. Usually but they're probably not gonna move this time. Man, we're just worrying about the here and now. We have a little uh a push to try to try to make it into the playoffs. So I think that's the main focus. The only focus and the main concern right now. Three. Yeah two boys and a girl. Yeah they're in Sac. Eleven, eight, and seven. Yeah, uh so they're meeting people or meeting kids. Finding friends have they little routines and all that so don't want to disrupt that right now in the middle of the school year.",3
"Uh, I felt uh pretty normal once uh once I got out on the court. A little confused about what we doing. But once I once the coach talks to me told me just go out and play and my teammates tell me just go out and play. So that's what I what I tried to do. I'm more of a I like to win guy than how I play. So um it means nothing cuz we didn't win. Yeah just a little bit of a the sets, the calls and stuff. Trying to get used to hearing new calls for the same plays everybody else runs. I think this is a talented group. Guys get injured. That's probably why I'm here now cuz they have a lot of injuries. Uh but uh I think they're pretty resilient. They've been fighting every game. They play hard every night so hopefully play hard and winning. We'll figure that out. Ah man, when you playing against him you just, you know it's like, it's like a this little dude is hitting everything. And when you playing with him, well since this is my first time getting a chance to be with teammates when I'm on the court it's like damn he really hitting everything. That's what he does. And uh it's uh when you need a bucket, he's definitely a bucket. We got a bunch of them around here. Uh well that's what I've been used to so when I'm back in my natural habitat. Uh I'm just trying to play the right play the right way and hopefully hopefully things work. Uh, it's more opportunity. It's a different opportunity. More of uh I guess you could say uh peers. I have uh peers here so it's uh a little bit more comfortable.",0
"Well for us, uh we started the game off slow and once our energy uh once our energy picked up, our defense picked up, our scoring picked up. We were able to pick them apart a little bit. Man, I'm real comfortable. It's easy. All I gotta do is kinda find the open gaps, spot up, play defense. It's easy. Um, well once again I'm playing with another unbelievable player. Uh a hall-of-famer. CJ who's unbelievable. [inaudible], young guys everybody who's here is extremely talented and they're learning a lot and I'm able to learn from the players that's been here already too. You know you watch him on TV and you see him do some amazing things but being able to see him do it on a nightly basis, is is almost mind-blowing. It's crazy. Thank you",3
