# Classifying NBA Player Sentiment Through Player Interviews
## Skyler Hallinan, Arthur Beyer
### CSE 490G1 Final Project

Write a 3-4 sentence abstract. It should introduce the problem and your approach. You may also want some numbers like 35 mAP and 78% accuracy. You can use this example README for your project, you can use a different ordering for your website, or you can make a totally different website altogether!

VIDEO GOES HERE (probably): Record a 2-3 minute long video presenting your work. One option - take all your figures/example images/charts that you made for your website and put them in a slide deck, then record the video over zoom or some other recording platform (screen record using Quicktime on Mac OS works well). The video doesn't have to be particularly well produced or anything.

## Introduction

In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teamwork is essential. However, chemistry issues between teammates often plague teams, leading to issues on and off the court, potentially leading to losses, social media bouts, and players being traded to other teams. It is therefore essential for teams to identify and remediate public and private discontent expressed by its players to prevent implosions.
 
One example of such an implosion was on the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2019. After a particularly rough stretch former player Jimmy Butler famously challenged his teammates, saying “You f——ng need me! You can’t win without me!” This caused a rift and days later he was traded to another team. Although chemistry issues sometimes manifest in these explicit and obvious forms, other problems may be more subtle. Before he was traded, former Cleveland Cavalier Isaiah Thomas remarked to reporters, “That’s what this team has been this whole season: inconsistent.” Although not as direct as Butler’s statement, this was a similarly negative statement to Butler’s, showing his discontent with the team. 
    
To target and dispel these issues associated with player unhappiness, in this work we seek to build an automatic classifier that can quickly assess the sentiment given a particular response or interview from a player. Although there exists one dataset of NBA player interviews, almost all of the data comes from formal press conferences which often involve other players, coaches, and/or a more scrutinous media; this may restrict the extent to which players speak freely and may not be helpful to annotate on sentiment, as we anticipate a homogenous set of somewhat uncontroversial responses.

Instead, we train our model on informal postgame, pregame, and post-practice interviews, which we denote Informal Game and Practice Interviews (IGPIs). These interviews are semi-structured, question-and-answer style discussions, where players freely answer questions from reporters without the influence of coaches or teammates. As such, IGPIs may reveal important insights into a player’s relationships with their team and coaching staff. 

However, there is a lack of public annotated IGPIs. To remediate this, we present a novel
corpus of about 150 IGPIs ranging from one to ten minutes each, from 33 players over the last three years, each transcribed verbatim from publicly available video interviews online on YouTube and on NBA.com. We also provide metadata related to these interviews, such as the date, the player name, and what team they were on. Finally, we also provide sentiment annotations for each interview for our classification task, using a scale from 0-3.

With the new corpus, we train several sentiment classification models with a variety of LSTM architectures on both character and word level embeddings and demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we show a demonstration of our system in use.

## Approach

One of the biggest parts of this project was the annotation. We spent a collective roughly 40 hours meticulously annotating the interviews verbatim. We even included words like “Um” and “Uh” and included all punctuation, to the best of our ability. (We estimate each interview is 4 minutes long. And for each interview minute, it takes about 4 minutes to annotate, so each interview roughly takes 16 minutes to annotate. We have 143 interviews, so that’s 16*143=2288 minutes converted to hours is about 40 hours).

Once we had the interviews annotated, we next had to annotate the sentiment for each interview. We chose a sentiment score from 0 to 3 for each player where we perceived their attitude to be:
* 0: Extremely unhappy/discontent
* 1: Somewhat unhappy/discontent
* 2: Somewhat happy/content
* 3: Extremely happy/content
This took about 2 minutes per interview so roughly 4 hours total

Once we had all the data we were going to use for this project, we started working on finding the best model that could fit our data. We considered parsing our data character-by-character and word-by-word. We also considered using a bag-of-words approach but thought that sequence based models would perform better than simply counting appearances of words. For this 

## Results

How did you evaluate your approach? How well did you do? What are you comparing to? Maybe you want ablation studies or comparisons of different methods.

You may want some qualitative results and quantitative results. Example images/text/whatever are good. Charts are also good. Maybe loss curves or AUC charts. Whatever makes sense for your evaluation.
